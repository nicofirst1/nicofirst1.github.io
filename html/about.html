		Hello there! <br>
		You must be really bored to check this out, but since you're here let's give it a chance! <br> <br>

		During my young age, I invested a major part of my free time playing games. I got lost in the fantasy world of
		<a class="def-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeons_%26_Dragons">Dungeon and Dragons</a> where I
		matured my narrating skills and my open mind.
		<br>
		Video games were of course part of the equation. <br>
		In them, I first encountered artificial intelligence in the way the NPCs were programmed and I grew a strong
		desire to understand them deeper.

		<br> <br>

		During my studies as an engineer, I developed a strong relationship with the field of computer science and
		mathematical modeling.<br>
		To me the concept of explaining and controlling the real world with man-made numbers and robots was a
		revelation, and it still is.
		<br> <br>
		I advanced through my bachelor with dedication and enthusiasm, cutting out (a little too much) time to develop
		all kinds of <a href="#projects" class="def-link">projects</a> spacing from home surveillance to simple
		sentiment analysis.
		<br> <br>

		But studying is not my whole life, a major part of what I am I owe it to martial arts, and in particular <a
			href="https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muay_thai" class="def-link">Muay Thai</a> which I practiced for over 5
		years. It taught me to discipline myself in the moments of weakness
		and together with <a href="https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krav_Maga" class="def-link">Krav Maga</a> and <a
			href="https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taekwondo" class="def-link">Taekwondo</a> , trained my body and mind for
		the past 10 years.
		<br><br>

		After an internship in the <a href="http://www.tradr-project.eu/" class="def-link">TRADR</a> european project,
		where I learnt what team work really is, I undertook the
		master in <a href="Artificial Intelligence and robotics in Sapienza university" class="def-link">Artificial
			Intelligence and Robotics at Sapienza University</a> .
		<br>
		The path was arduous but equally exciting.
		<br><br>

		During this period I learnt about Reinforcement Learning [RL] and set my mind to it.
		<br>
		After an exchange program in the University of Groningen, where I further strengthen my english skills,
		I began my master thesis on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mafia_(party_game)" class="def-link">Mafia party game</a> with Reinforcement Learning and graduated as an engineer in
		Artificial Intelligence and Robotics.
		<br><br>

		Right now I am undergoing my PhD on multi agent communication in RL environments.
		<br>
		I'm always open for discussion on any kind of argument both by mail or with a big mug of beer (possibly stout).
