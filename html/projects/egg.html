        EGG is a toolkit that allows researchers to quickly implement multi-agent games with discrete channel communication. In such games, the agents are trained to communicate with each other and jointly solve a task. Often, the way they communicate is not explicitly determined, allowing agents to come up with their own 'language' in order to solve the task. Such setup opens a plethora of possibilities in studying emergent language and the impact of the nature of task being solved, the agents' models, etc. This subject is a vibrant area of research often considered as a prerequisite for general AI. The purpose of EGG is to offer researchers an easy and fast entry point into this research area.

        EGG is based on PyTorch and provides: (a) simple, yet powerful components for implementing communication between agents, (b) a diverse set of pre-implemented games, (c) an interface to analyse the emergent communication protocols.
        
        Key features:
        
            Primitives for implementing a single-symbol or variable-length communication (with vanilla RNNs, GRUs, LSTMs or Transformers);
            Training with optimization of the communication channel with REINFORCE or Gumbel-Softmax relaxation via a common interface;
            Simplified configuration of the general components, such as checkpointing, optimization, tensorboard support, etc;
            Provides a simple CUDA-aware command-line tool for grid-search over parameters of the games.
        
        To fully leverage EGG one would need at least a high-level familiarity with PyTorch. However, to get a taste of communication games without writing any code, you could try a dataset-based game, which allow you to experiment with different signaling games by simply editing input files.
