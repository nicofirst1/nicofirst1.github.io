    <div class="project-description">
        As a first time robotic student I found myself struggling to understand the basic computations which are fundamental for the study of manipulators.
        <br>

        To get myself familiar with this I created this matlab module which is based on the Symbolic toolbox. For the ones that are not familiar with matlab, the symbolic toolbox provides functions for solving, plotting, and manipulating symbolic math equations.
        <br>
        Rather than solving equations and outputting numbers, I focused on having a reference between theory and practice. This toolbox is not ment to be used on a real robot, but it should be rather used while solving exercises.
