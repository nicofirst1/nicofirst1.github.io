        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        Multi agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL) has been studied intensively for its ability to develop complex behaviors from a simple set of rules. One of its field is the analysis of emergent communication in articulated environment such as social deduction games.
        <br>
        In this thesis we investigate if and how various form of communication channels influence the outcomes of the Werewolf deduction game with deep RL . We first study the game with a wide range of mathematical models drawing the basis for the later analysis.
        <br>
        Then we show how the introduction of a communication signal greatly increases the winning rate of the players for two different kind of settings; in particular we analyze the results for diverse game logic and prove that each one is positively influenced by said signal.
        <br>
        Finally we study the effect of the channel's length and range on the overall performance and prove a non linear relationship between the two.
