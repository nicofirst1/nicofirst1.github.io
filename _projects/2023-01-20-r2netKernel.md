## CAIRNE

[CAIRNE](https://claire-ai.org/) (formerly CLAIRE)  seeks to strengthen European excellence in AI research and innovation. The network forms a pan-European Confederation of Laboratories for Artificial Intelligence Research in Europe. Its member groups and organizations are committed to working together towards realizing the vision of CAIRNE: European excellence across all of AI, for all of Europe, with a human-centred focus.

CAIRNE (Confederation of Laboratories for Artificial Intelligence Research in Europe ) has more than 435 labs in 37 countries, counting 24k researchers.

## R2Net

The [Rising Researchers Network (R2Net)](https://claire-ai.org/r2network/) aims to gather graduate students, especially Ph.D. students, postdocs, and master students, involved in AI research, who believe in European excellence in AI and that ethical and human-centered AI should be the norm of AI research and development in the future.

### My contribution

I first joined the network on January 2022 and became a part of the CORE team organization.

As a member of the Kernel team of R2Net, I have made significant contributions to the network's efforts towards promoting European excellence in AI research and innovation. My responsibilities include planning for the summer school program, arranging partnerships, organizing social activities and supporting the general sponsorship of the network.

Through my hard work and dedication, I was able to secure several partnerships that greatly benefited the network and its members. I also played an instrumental role in organizing successful social activities that helped to foster a sense of community among our members and create opportunities for networking and collaboration.

In recognition of my contributions, I was promoted to a kernel member after just 10 months of being part of the network. As a kernel member, I serve as the first line of contact between CAIRNE and the R2Net members, providing support and guidance to help ensure the network's continued growth and success.

I am passionate about advancing AI research and development in a way that is ethical, human-centered and in line with European values. Through my work with CAIRNE and R2Net, I am helping to make this vision a reality and support the next generation of AI researchers and innovators.
