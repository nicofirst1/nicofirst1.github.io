Multi agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL) has been studied intensively for its ability to develop complex behaviors from a simple set of rules. One of its field is the analysis of emergent communication in articulated environment such as social deduction games.
In this thesis we investigate if and how various form of communication channels influence the outcomes of the Werewolf deduction game with deep RL . We first study the game with a wide range of mathematical models drawing the basis for the later analysis.
Then we show how the introduction of a communication signal greatly increases the winning rate of the players for two different kind of settings; in particular we analyze the results for diverse game logic and prove that each one is positively influenced by said signal.
Finally we study the effect of the channel's length and range on the overall performance and prove a non linear relationship between the two.
