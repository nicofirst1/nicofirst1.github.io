**CivicEye** is a lightweight, privacy-conscious web app designed to identify and visualize civic number matches within a given postal code.  
It integrates **OpenStreetMap data** for candidate retrieval and **Google Maps Static API** for visual confirmation, using optional **image embeddings** to compare and rank address snapshots.

The tool was conceived as a practical experiment in geodata accessibility and visual reasoning.  
Users can input a postal code and a civic number to automatically generate map images, browse candidate matches, and—if enabled—rank them by similarity.  
CivicEye runs entirely in Streamlit, is open-source, and uses strict API and budget restrictions to prevent misuse, demonstrating how reproducible AI-assisted geovisual tools can remain both transparent and secure.
