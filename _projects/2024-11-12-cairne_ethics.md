I am an active member of the CAIRNE [Special Interest Group on Ethical, Legal, and Social Aspects of Artificial Intelligence](https://cairne.eu/sig-els/#:~:text=The%20CAIRNE%20Special%20Interest%20Group%20on%20Ethical%2C%20Legal%20and%20Social,CAIRNE%20community%20and%20the%20public) (SIG-ELS), a group dedicated to addressing the pressing need for deeper insights into the ethical, legal, and social aspects of AI. This group focuses on ensuring that AI technologies are designed and evaluated with these considerations in mind throughout the development and implementation process, promoting responsible, sustainable, and trustworthy innovation within the EU.

As part of my involvement in this group, I collaborate with researchers and experts to explore how we can ensure AI systems are developed ethically and responsibly. My contributions include participating in discussions on ethical hot topics, sharing perspectives on dilemmas such as bias and fairness, and contributing to workshops and seminars that promote the responsible use of AI tools. We aim to foster an open environment for discussion and support collaboration on developing new research and tools for ethical AI.
