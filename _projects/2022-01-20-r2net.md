## CLAIRE
[CLAIRE](https://claire-ai.org/)  seeks to strengthen European excellence in AI research and innovation. The network forms a pan-European Confederation of Laboratories for Artificial Intelligence Research in Europe. Its member groups and organisations are committed to working together towards realising the vision of CLAIRE: European excellence across all of AI, for all of Europe, with a human-centred focus.

CLAIRE (Confederation of Laboratories for Artificial Intelligence Research in Europe ) has more than 435 labs in 37 countries, counting 24k researchers.

## R2Net

The Rising Researchers Network aims to gather graduate students, especially Ph.D. students, postdocs, and master students, involved in AI research, who believe in European excellence in AI and that ethical and human-centered AI should be the norm of AI research and development in the future.
