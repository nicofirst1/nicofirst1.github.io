### Overview

Multi  agent  model  based  reinforcement  learning  (MAM-BRL) is a relatively new field which merge together two well established scientific areas:
1. Multi agent systems(MAS):  studies  the  complex  behavior arising from a group of intelligent entities. Such individuals  are  not  restricted  to  be  artificial  but  can  be animals,  humans  or  planets  in  a  solar  system.  The  aim of this field is to understand, predict and sometime copy such  patterns  in  order  to  comprehend  the  underlying rules and aid humanity.
2.   Reinforcement  Learning  (RL)  :  reinforcement  learning was  first  considered  in  psychology,  and  specifically  in learning  theory.  Its  core  idea  is  that  humans,  as  well as  animals,  learn  by  acting  in  a  reality  and  getting  a feedback  which  can  be  positive  (reward)  or  negative (penalty).  This  field  has  also  proven  to  be  immensely helpful for artificial intelligence where is now one of its most prolific fields.


### Description of the Problem

Consider **N** points on a 2D plane which need to be visited at least once by  **M** bots. Provide a path for all of the **M** bots such that the total distance travelled by the bots is minimum.
