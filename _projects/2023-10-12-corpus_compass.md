### Description
As the need for effective tools in Corpus Linguistics continues to grow, particularly for under-resourced languages and nonstandard annotation tasks, specialized software has become essential for processing and analyzing large and complex datasets. CorpusCompass is a free and open access tool for researchers in the field of Corpus Linguistics that provides a versatile way to create structured datasets from previously annotated corpora. It allows custom annotation schemes and efficient extraction as well as the analysis of diverse linguistic information. By defining variables of interest and annotation rules, researchers can tailor the tool to their specific needs, making it particularly valuable for unique linguistic research domains. When used in conjunction with statistical analysis or visualization tools, CorpusCompass helps researchers to gain insights into the factors that are affecting language use.

#### Outcomes

- CorpusCompass won the [UvA Research Software Engineering grant](https://dsc.uva.nl/programmes/research-software-engineering-support/research-software-engineering.html) for which I am a Co-Principal Investigator.
- The CorpusCompass paper was accepted at [Clic-IT 2023](https://clic2023.ilc.cnr.it/), you can find it [here]().
