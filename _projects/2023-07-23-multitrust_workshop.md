[MULTITTRUST](https://multittrust.github.io/2ed/) was a workshop of HAI conference 2023. Trust, a vital construct within mixed human-robot teams, has been studied extensively across disciplines, particularly in human-computer interaction and psychology. However, considering the complex dynamics and diverse team compositions, a comprehensive understanding of trust in human-AI teams remains elusive. This second edition focuses on integrating knowledge across fields with the goal of enhancing computational methods to estimate trust in human-AI teams. We aimed to facilitate meaningful conversations and collaborations among researchers from various disciplines, including psychology, sociology, cognitive science, computer science, artificial intelligence.
