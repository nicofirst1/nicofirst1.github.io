### Overview
Corpus linguistics tools become increasingly important in the work with large corpora and in the statistical analysis of complex linguistic data. To process and analyze them, specialized software tools are required. CorpusCompass is a free and open access tool for researchers in the field of Corpus Linguistics that provides a convenient way to create structured datasets from (manually or automatically) annotated corpora. It allows researchers to efficiently extract and analyze data including different types of linguistic information. By defining variables and annotation rules, researchers can tailor the tool to their specific  needs. Moreover, CorpusCompass includes features for debugging missing annotations and identifying unexpected correlations in the data. When used in conjunction with statistical analysis or visualization tools, CorpusCompass helps researchers to gain insights into the factors that are affecting language use. In this paper, we introduce the tool and give a real-world example in the field of language variation.
