The MultiTTrust project focuses on advancing multidisciplinary perspectives on trust within human-AI teams, especially as these teams become integral to diverse fields. As a member of the steering committee, I contributed to shaping the projectâ€™s direction and organized a [major workshop](https://multittrust.github.io/2ed/) under the HAI Conference 2023. This workshop brought together experts in psychology, cognitive science, sociology, computer science, and artificial intelligence to foster a holistic approach to understanding and building trust in human-AI collaborations. Additionally, I served as the lead guest editor for the [Special Issue at Interaction Studies](https://multittrust.github.io/SI1/) , curating insights that aim to drive forward computational and theoretical models of trust across diverse human-AI applications.
