What if music could be used as a powerful tool for education? In many ways, this is already happening (think of the ABC song), which has helped generations of children learn the alphabet. However, creating music takes time, effort, and skill, which makes it difficult to apply this approach to a wide range of concepts.

With the advent of AI-generated music, though, things are changing. This project explores the **use of AI-driven songs as an educational tool**, leveraging technology to make learning more engaging and accessible. It combines my passion for music (mostly as a listener, though I play some drums), my interest in AI, and my dedication to education in an attempt to create something that benefits people

Of course, I can already anticipate concerns. Some may argue that music is a deeply human art form, meant for emotional expression, and that AI-generated compositions strip away these qualities. I don’t disagree. I am not here to claim that this kind of music is art in the traditional sense. However, if we separate music from its artistic and expressive components and view it instead as a communication tool, then AI-generated music becomes an opportunity rather than a threat. In this context, AI isn’t replacing human creativity—it’s enhancing the way we share and reinforce knowledge.

Another valid concern is the issue of copyright and intellectual property. AI models, including [Suno](https://suno.com/) (the platform I’m using), have been trained on vast datasets that include copyrighted material. In fact, Suno has [admitted to training on 'essentially all music files of reasonable quality that are accessible on the open internet'](https://www.404media.co/ai-music-generator-suno-admits-it-was-trained-on-essentially-all-music-files-on-the-internet/#:~:text=The%20AI%20music%20generator%20company,tens%20of%20millions%20of%20recordings.%E2%80%9D). I do not approve of this unregulated use of copyrighted music, and I believe AI providers should fairly compensate musicians and intellectual property owners, either directly or through broader societal mechanisms. This is an ongoing legal and ethical debate—one that is now in the hands of legislators and courts.

For now, my goal is to make the most of these technologies for beneficial and educational purposes. AI-generated music may not replace human artistry, but it has the potential to transform the way we teach and learn.
