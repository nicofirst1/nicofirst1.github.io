The score of this document is to keep track on the EU research organization. Basically, how does eu coordinate research (with a focus on ai)? how many organizational bodies are there (seems to be plenty)? How are they structure? What do they do?
Let's start

## List of EU AI policies
Of course the [EU AI ACT](https://artificialintelligenceact.eu/), easy peasy

### Coordinated Plan on Artificial Intelligence
Then we have the [Coordinated Plan on Artificial Intelligence](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/plan-ai).
published in 2018 and updated in 2021. The plan is to make EU a global leader in trustworthy AI alligning to [green priorities](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/green-digital) by investing a minimum of  €1 billion annual investments from the [Horizon Europe](https://research-and-innovation.ec.europa.eu/funding/funding-opportunities/funding-programmes-and-open-calls/horizon-europe_en)

The plan is based on 4 policy reflecting key objectives in AI. Before going in depth on the objectives. Let's see how they plan to actualize them:


#### 1. Enabling conditions for AI’s development and uptake
Also called [enabling ai](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/enabling-ai) because it wants to enable AI research in eu. they do so by:
- Creating [AI Factories](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/ai-factories) which is an amend to the EuroHPC JU
- Created the [GenAI4EU](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/ai-office#ecl-inpage-genai4eu), a pretty new package (jan 2024) to support startups (how?) 

##### AI Factories
AI Factories include AI-dedicated supercomputers, associated data centres - in proximity or connected via high-speed networks - and the human capital to use these resources effectively. Thus, they bring together supercomputing and AI experts, data specialists, researchers, startups and end users.

AI Factories leverage the supercomputing capacity of the EuroHPC Joint Undertaking to develop trustworthy cutting-edge generative AI models.  so it seems to be [a package of measure](https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_24_383) that promotes
the  use of [ EuroHPC JU](https://eurohpc-ju.europa.eu/index_en) to facilitate access to supercomputer for ai  to startups and innovators

#### 2. Thriving from the lab to the market

Also knows as [aiLabMarket](https://diorganisationsgital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/ai-lab-market), it basically they want to foster cooperation in AI in europe to attract talents and foster PPP. 
With this in mind:
-  they created [ADRA](https://adr-association.eu/) in june 2021, which is mostly related to PPP.
- It also created the [European Networks of Excellence in AI (NoEs) ](https://www.vision4ai.eu/community/) 
- from jan 2024, they also created the  [testing and experimentation facilities (TEFs)](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/activities/testing-and-experimentation-facilities)
- Then they decided to create the [AI-on-demand platform (AIoD)](https://www.ai4europe.eu/) which is the communication channel between researchers, industry and public services
- European Digital Innovation Hubs
- Fund and scale innovative ideas and solutions for AI where the eu plans to invest 1 billion per year in AI 



#####  AI, Data and Robotics Association (ADRA)
Adra was awarded 2.6B euros from the Horizon 2020 (2014-2020) and Horizon Europe (2021-2027). It's objective is to promote PPP and was created by the join effort of :
1. [Big Data Value Association (BDVA)](https://bdva.eu/)
2. [Confederation of Laboratories for Artificial Intelligence Research in Europe (CLAIRE)](https://claire-ai.org/)
3. [European Laboratory for Learning and Intelligent Systems (ELLIS)](https://ellis.eu/)
4. [European Association for Artificial Intelligence (EurAI)](https://www.eurai.org/)
5. [European Robotic Forum (euRobotics)](https://eu-robotics.net/)

They now have two taskforce, one for GenAI and won for GenAI applications in robotics. 
their Focus is Mainly on fostering PPPs, thus linking academic research with industrial application to create synergies and accelerate AI and robotics innovation.



#####  Networks of Excellence Centres (NoEs)

Funded under Horizon2020 and newly Horizon Europe. And includes 9 projects: 
1. [AI4media](https://www.ai4media.eu/)
2. [ELISE](https://www.elise-ai.eu/)
3. [Humane-AI net](https://www.humane-ai.eu/)
4. [TAILOR](https://tailor-network.eu/)
5. [ELSA](https://elsa-ai.eu/)
6. [euROBIN](https://www.eurobin-project.eu/)
7. [ELIAS](https://elias-ai.eu/)
8. [dAIedge](https://daiedge.eu/)
9. [Enfield](https://www.enfield-project.eu/)


Where the first 4 in 2020. 5 and 6 in 2022 and the last 3 since 2023
It reports to be strongly linked to ADRA and wants all the projects to communicate via the  [AI-on-demand platform (AIoD)](https://www.ai4europe.eu/) platform.

The whole site is actually hosted under the vision4ai name. 
The focus is Mainly academic, fostering research excellence and creating a critical mass of European AI knowledge and talent. They aim to push fundamental research and innovation in AI but have a more academic and research-oriented perspective compared to ADRA.



##### Testing and experimentation facilities (TEFs)

Of course you need to give spaces to SME (small and medium buisinesses), aka the startups in the PPP the eu wants to promote, space to test their ais. 
For this reason they created the [Testing and Experimentation Facilities (TEFs) for AI.](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/activities/testing-and-experimentation-facilities) (220 million) for t4 sectors : 
- Healthcare with [TEF-Health](https://tefhealth.eu/home)
- Agri-food with [AgrifoodTEF](https://www.agrifoodtef.eu/)
- Manufacturing with [AI Matters](https://ai-matters.eu/)
- Smart Cities & Communities with [Citcom.ai](https://citcom.ai/?trk=article-ssr-frontend-pulse_little-text-block)

Apparently they where tested in march 2024 and deemed to be ready to test SMEs.


##### AI-on-demand platform (AIoD)
Apart from having the slowest website ever which seems to be created by a particularly skilled 15 old teen, the platform is supported by an ecosystem of projects funded under Horizon 2020 and Horizon Europe (focus on research), and Digital Europe programme (focus on industry and public administration). The current version of the platform includes several services:
- An assets catalogue, aka the [MyLibrary](https://mylibrary.aiod.eu/marketplace) where you can get access to AI models, datasets and experiments on the dataset parts it seems to have only stuff from HF. The models seems to come from [Bonseyes](https://www.bonseyes.eu/) (a marketplace for AI in cloud and edge) and [OpenML](https://www.openml.org/) (another platform for AI stuff)
- [Research Bundles](https://www.ai4europe.eu/research/research-bundles) : give you a space in the AI on-demand platform where you can collect and publish the outputs of a small research project in a compact way. A research bundle collects in a single place all the assets (code, data, tutorials, examples, ...) produced by your project and published on the AI on-demand platform. Of course, you can also put links to assets published elsewhere, like Github or Zenodo.
- An [AI builder](https://aiexp.ai4europe.eu/#/home)  in partnership with Eclispe built at fraunohfer iais
- [Research and Innovation AI Lab (RAIL)](https://rail.aiod.eu/docs/about) a beta version of what seems to be an educational orietned platform to use AioD assets





#####  European Digital Innovation Hubs (EDIHs)
Seems to be another network dedicated to helping SME and PSO to digitalise and adhere to EU guidelines. Not really sure what's the difference between this and ADRA/NoES. The websites says "EDIHs help all companies seeking to use AI technologies to become more competitive on business/production processes, products or services."
This newtork also seems interested in [bringing AI in the public administration](https://european-digital-innovation-hubs.ec.europa.eu/knowledge-hub/thematic-groups/public-administration-main-focus-artificial-intelligence)

Unlike ADRA and NoEs, which focus more on research and innovation, EDIHs are focused on practical applications of AI technologies for businesses and public administration. They are key to promoting the digitalization of European industries.




#### 3. Ensuring that AI works for people (AI-People)

The last ai policy is [Ensuring that AI works for people](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/ai-people). It is split in 3 parts


##### Nurturing talent and improving skills
Basically they want to create and KEEP talents in AI in Europe.  They want to do so by: 
- Supporting traineeships in digital areas. They cite the [Digital Education Action Plan (DEAP)](https://education.ec.europa.eu/focus-topics/digital-education/action-plan) but it is unclear to which of the 13 articles this refers to. Or if the DEAP is part ot the coordinated plan (unlikely)
- Launch a call for specialised education programmes and courses in key areas, under the Digital Europe Programme. This is probably part of the [Action 8 of DEAP](https://education.ec.europa.eu/focus-topics/digital-education/action-plan/action-8?) which aims to educate and train professionals in all sectors to use AI in their work. It interestingly mentions the [Digital Competence Framework v2.2](https://publications.jrc.ec.europa.eu/repository/handle/JRC128415), which seems to be yet another piece of the puzzle. 
- support networks of AI excellence centres to retain talent and develop PhD programmes and AI modules under the Horizon Europe programme. this is probably connected with the NoEs mentioned above
- und doctoral networks, postdoctoral fellowships and staff exchange projects in AI under the Marie Skłodowska-Curie actions. 
- support the development of new skills under the [Skills Agenda](https://ec.europa.eu/social/main.jsp?catId=1223&langId=en). 


##### Developing a policy framework to ensure trust in AI systems
Basically ensuring that AI doesn't screw up society. 
Again we have more points here, with zero links but we can take guesses:
- a proposal for a horizontal framework for AI, focusing on safety and respect for fundamental rights specific to AI technologies. This smells alot like the [EU AI ACT](https://artificialintelligenceact.eu/)
- EU measures adapting the liability framework to the challenges of new technologies, including AI.
- revisions to existing sectoral safety legislation
- security operation centres, powered by AI, to act as a 'cybershield’ for the EU, able to detect signs of a cyberattack early enough and to enable proactive action

##### Promoting the EU vision on sustainable and trustworthy AI in the world
This point is more about making Eu leader in regulations on ai. It follows the direction of the [Digital Compass](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/europes-digital-decade) and the [International outreach for human-centric artificial intelligence initiative](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/international-outreach-ai)
