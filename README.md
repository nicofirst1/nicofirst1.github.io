# Personal Website (https://nileshnegi.github.io)

Version 4:

* Inspired by Andrej Karpathy's implementation (https://karpathy.ai/) of a lightweight webpage design.
* Based on Plain-Academic by Vasilios Mavroudis (https://github.com/mavroudisv/plain-academic).
* Borrowed certain CSS elements from Â©Copyright Kards 2016. Design by Styleshout (http://www.styleshout.com).

I had to discontinue using the earlier template (v3) based on KARDS, due to long load times.
