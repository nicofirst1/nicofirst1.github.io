In the labyrinth of policies, projects, and organizations shaping the EU’s AI landscape, staying informed can feel overwhelming. To help navigate this complexity, I developed **PolAI Graph** (short for Policy AI Graph), an interactive visualization tool designed to map and explore connections between EU AI-related entities. Whether you’re a researcher, policymaker, or AI enthusiast, PolAI Graph provides a clear view of how initiatives, policies, and stakeholders interlink, making it easier to understand the bigger picture.
 If you prefer to see it in action before diving in, check out the [interactive graph here](/euai_graph/).

### The Inspiration Behind PolAI Graph
It all started when I looked into the [Coordinated Plan on Artificial Intelligence](/news/eu-and-research/), part of the EU's broader digital strategy. As I traced links between various projects I realized these initiatives weren’t just stand-alone efforts. They represented a vast ecosystem of interrelated goals, funding mechanisms, and collaborative networks.

However, making sense of these connections using static documents and reports felt like navigating a maze blindfolded. I wanted something more intuitive—a way to see the connections, click through them, and build a mental map of the EU AI landscape. That’s how PolAI Graph was born.

### Features of PolAI Graph

1. **Interactive Visualization**:
   At its core, PolAI Graph is a graph-based visualization tool. Each node represents an AI-related entity—be it a policy, fund, or organization—while links denote relationships, such as funding sources or collaborative partnerships.

2. **Color-Coded Categories**:
   Nodes are categorized into groups like Policies, Projects, Organizations, and Funds, each with a distinct color. This makes it easy to distinguish the roles of various entities at a glance.

3. **Rich Node Information**:
   Clicking on a node opens a sidebar displaying detailed information:
   - Full name
   - Abbreviation (if applicable)
   - Description
   - Links to official pages
   - Key attributes like budget, start/end dates, and coordinators

4. **Filters for Targeted Insights**:
   Users can filter the graph by category, highlighting only the nodes they’re interested in. For example, you can choose to display only "Funds" (by clicking on the legend) to explore the financial backbone of EU AI initiatives.

5. **Dynamic Updates**: The graph is continuously updated to reflect new connections or projects, ensuring it remains a living document of the EU AI landscape.



### How It Works

PolAI Graph leverages a **D3.js-powered visualization engine**, processing JSON data that outlines nodes (entities) and links (connections). This JSON file is [openly available here](https://github.com/nicofirst1/nicofirst1.github.io/blob/master/assets/data/euai_data.json), allowing anyone to explore, verify, or even expand the dataset to include additional connections and entities. By keeping the data open and accessible, PolAI Graph invites collaboration and transparency, ensuring the tool evolves alongside the AI landscape.


### Why PolAI Graph Matters

The EU’s approach to AI is as ambitious as it is complex. Understanding how initiatives like [GenAI4EU](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/genai4eu) or [Testing and Experimentation Facilities (TEFs)](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/activities/testing-and-experimentation-facilities) fit into the larger ecosystem is crucial for policymakers, researchers, and businesses. PolAI Graph makes this understanding accessible by turning dense information into an interactive experience.

### What’s Next?

PolAI Graph is a work in progress. The next steps include:
- Adding **search functionality** to locate specific entities instantly.
- Incorporating **time sliders** to track how the EU AI landscape evolves over the years.
- Expanding node attributes to include visual indicators for funding amounts or project durations.

I invite you to explore the [PolAI Graph](/euai_graph/) and share your feedback. Together, we can refine this tool into a resource that not only maps the EU AI ecosystem but also empowers informed decision-making.
