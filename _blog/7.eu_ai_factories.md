```DISCALIMER:** The views and opinions expressed in this blog are solely my own and do not reflect those of my employer, or any of its affiliates. ```

> **TLDR;** AI Factories are Europe‚Äôs bet to **centralize AI resources and boost innovation**. Acting as **one-stop shops**, they offer supercomputing power, datasets, and expertise to startups, SMEs, and researchers. The initiative is funded up to **50% by the EU** and split into three tracks: appointing, upgrading, or building AI-optimized supercomputers. Factories integrate with **existing EU initiatives** like EDIHs, EDICs, and TEFs. Challenges remain in **coordination** and fostering **healthy competition**, but success could transform Europe‚Äôs AI ecosystem.



# Introduction

Here we go again!
Another deep dive into the ever-evolving EU AI landscape.

This time, I set out to understand **AI Factories**, a new initiative that aims to scale Europe‚Äôs AI capabilities and innovation. And what better way to figure it out than by writing a blog post?

Why now? Well, the EU recently announced the selection of [seven brand new AI Factories](https://eurohpc-ju.europa.eu/selection-first-seven-ai-factories-drive-europes-leadership-ai-2024-12-10_en) across Europe, marking a significant step forward in building state-of-the-art infrastructure to support AI innovation. It seemed like the perfect time to investigate what these factories are, what they‚Äôre supposed to do, and, of course, what this all means for Europe‚Äôs AI ambitions.


We briefly touched on AI Factories in the [first post of this series](/news/eu-and-research). Now that we have real-world progress to discuss, let‚Äôs focus on what AI Factories actually are, what they‚Äôre supposed to achieve, and why this matters for Europe‚Äôs AI future.


For the curious reader, my sources include:
- The official [Call for Expression of Interest.](https://eurohpc-ju.europa.eu/call-expression-interest-select-hosting-entities-acquiring-or-upgrading-eurohpc-supercomputers-ai_en)
- The [2021 regulation](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32021R1173) (2021/1173) that established the High Performance computing Joint Undertaking (EuroHPC JU).
- The [2024 amendment](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32024R1732) (2024/1732) that introduced the AI Factories as a priority.
- And, of course, the newly announced [list of accepted proposals](https://eurohpc-ju.europa.eu/selection-first-seven-ai-factories-drive-europes-leadership-ai-2024-12-10_en)


So, let‚Äôs dive in! üöÄ

## Current Status: Europe‚Äôs Seven AI Factories

If you‚Äôve been following AI developments over the past 4‚Äì5 years, you‚Äôll know we‚Äôre living in a pivotal moment. AI has brought both **hope** ‚Äì with advances in medicine, science, and productivity ‚Äì and **concern**, particularly around [growing inequality](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/ais-impact-on-income-inequality-in-the-us/?). Economically, though, the impact is undeniable. By 2030, PwC estimates [AI will contribute $15.7 trillion](https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/issues/artificial-intelligence/publications/artificial-intelligence-study.html?) to the global economy and boost GDP by **26%** in some regions.
  
Europe, however, has struggled to keep up. Despite its strengths in **regulatory leadership** and ethical AI, it lags in terms of AI companies and funding. To put it into perspective:

- Europe accounts for only **[14.5% of global AI companies](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1413456/major-economies-ai-companies-worldwide/?)** compared to **36.5% in the US** and **26.8% in China**.
- AI spending in the EU stands at **[‚Ç¨45 billion annually](https://sciencebusiness.net/news/ai-funding-and-research-china-and-us-outperform-europe?)**, far behind the **‚Ç¨300 billion in the US** and **‚Ç¨91 billion in China**.
- Programs like **Horizon Europe** have been crucial, but their average **‚Ç¨3 million contributions **haven‚Äôt been enough to ignite large-scale AI industry adoption ([check out my full analysis here](/news/blogpost-horizon-analysis/)).
  

To address this, the European Commission announced the first **seven AI Factories** on **December 10, 2024**, with ‚Ç¨1.5 billion in investments. These Factories are located in:

- **Finland**: *LUMI AI Factory* in Kajaani.
- **Germany**: *HammerHAI*  in Stuttgart.
- **Greece**: *Pharos* in Athens.
- **Italy**: *IT4LIA* in Bologna.
- **Luxembourg**: *L-AI Factory* in Bissen.
- **Spain**: *BSC AI Factory* in Barcellona.
- **Sweden**: *MIMER* in Link«íping.

The goal? To create hubs of innovation where startups, SMEs, researchers, and industry can collaborate, access critical infrastructure, and develop AI solutions.

This is Europe‚Äôs answer to scaling up its AI ecosystem. Instead of relying on scattered small-scale funding, the AI Factories aim to centralize resources and close the gap with global leaders like the US and China.


# What's an AI Factory? 

Let‚Äôs start with the easy part: **What‚Äôs an AI Factory (AIF for short)**?

At first, I‚Äôll admit, I had a completely different idea of what an AI Factory would look like. I imagined something more project-oriented ‚Äì like a company such as OpenAI or Anthropic ‚Äì spitting out generative AI models that are bigger, shinier, and fancier than anyone else‚Äôs[^eval_rant].
Turns out, I was wrong.


[^eval_rant]: Side note: I‚Äôm planning another post (read: rant) about why we need secret eval benchmarks. Currently, no one‚Äôs stopping companies from training on benchmarks themselves, which undermines scientific progress. Also, profit margins and science are way too aligned lately. Cutting corners for flashy papers? It‚Äôs happening. Let me know if you‚Äôd like me to dig into this!


#### The ‚ÄúFactory‚Äù Analogy

What I was missing was the ‚Äúfactory‚Äù part of AI Factory. Think of it like this (thanks to ChatGPT, which I‚Äôm shamelessly stealing this from):
- **Workers**: Researchers, companies, and developers.
- **Machinery**: Supercomputers and high-performance infrastructure.
- **Raw Materials**: Datasets, algorithms, and software tools.
- **Production Process**: AI training, fine-tuning, and experimentation workflows.
- **Final Product**: AI applications, solutions, and models ready to be deployed.


Easy, right? Well‚Ä¶ **ish**.

#### It‚Äôs a Physical Place

What really escaped me at the start was the sheer **physicality** of an AI Factory. This isn‚Äôt just some software program in the cloud or a collection of models sitting on a server. It‚Äôs a real, tangible place ‚Äì a building you can walk into, touch the walls, and open doors too.

And with that physicality comes **real-world problems** ‚Äì things you never think about when you‚Äôre running an AI model on your laptop. For example, a factory needs ([long list incoming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNyethAqJzk&ab_channel=Lo-FiGoliardica)):
- **Land** : Either build a brand-new facility (think [2300 square meters of high-tech centers](https://blogs.helmholtz.de/research-field-information/en/2024/01/25/next-milestone-for-jupiter-high-tech-base-for-the-european-exascale-supercomputer/?)), or retrofit an existing structure. That‚Äôs offices, server rooms, restrooms, meeting spaces ‚Äì the whole package.
- **Infrastructure**: Infrastructure: Cooling systems (water and air), enough electricity to power your supercomputers, internet connectivity (at least 100 Gbit/s to connect to other HPC systems), roads for employees, and backup diesel generators for when the power grid fails.
-  **Personnel**: 
   - Security teams to keep systems safe (and shoot down anyone who tries training on copyrighted data kidding, obviously).
   - Engineers to install and maintain hardware.
   - System admins to keep everything running smoothly.
   - Cleaning staff (because, you know, people work there).
-  **Technical Equipment**: 
   -  Supercomputers and GPUs (the sweet, sweet GPUs). 
   -  Storage systems for enormous datasets.
   -  High-resolution monitors, servers, and all the peripherals you need.
   -  And as Italians say, ["chi pi√π ne ha pi√π ne metta"](https://www.wordreference.com/iten/Chi%20pi%C3%B9%20ne%20ha%20pi%C3%B9%20ne%20metta) ‚Äì ‚Äúthe more, the better.‚Äù 


And that‚Äôs just the **physical setup**. We haven‚Äôt even started talking about what an AI Factory actually **does**!



# What is it supposed to do?
Good question! To answer that, let‚Äôs take a step back and look around. üëÄ

What do we see? Oh, look, it‚Äôs an LLM. It can process text and images? It speaks and understands speech?? OMG, it‚Äôs basically agentic now! 

AI‚Äôs capabilities have exploded in the past few years, and that growth has sparked a need for something bigger ‚Äì something centralized, powerful, and accessible.

Enter the **AI Factory**.

## The Purpose of an AI Factory

<!-- 
For this reason the proposal puts alot on emphasis on how you connect the factory with preexisting netwroks (such as the EIDCs and EIDHs) and align it's goal with the national ones. The factory is more than one project, is a place where pp go when they need ai solutions. This solution include both access to fundational (multimodal)models, but also particular datasets on which you want to train your system,experteese when it comes to ai and hpc al the way to the actual hpc resources themselves. -->


According to the call for proposals, an AI Factory "shall create a one-stop shop for the users, including startups, small and medium-sized enterprises, and scientific users, to facilitate access to its support services."

Let‚Äôs break that down.

This isn‚Äôt just about putting a big shiny supercomputer somewhere. An AI Factory is where **AI innovation meets its users** and **turns ideas into solutions**. It connects resources, tools, and expertise under one roof, enabling users to:
- Access foundational models and specialized datasets.
- Train and fine-tune AI systems on high-performance computing (HPC) infrastructure.
- Collaborate with AI and HPC experts to solve technical challenges.

What makes these factories unique is their emphasis on **integration**. They aren‚Äôt isolated projects; they are part of a larger ecosystem. To succeed, AI Factories need to plug into existing EU initiatives like the **European Digital Innovation Hubs** ([EDIHs](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/activities/edihs)), **European Digital Infrastructure Consortiums** ([EDICs](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/edic)), the **Common European Data Spaces** ([CEDS](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/data-spaces)) and the Testing and Experimentation Facilities ([TEFs](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/faqs/testing-and-experimentation-facilities-tefs-questions-and-answers))[^cover]. These connections ensure that AI Factories don‚Äôt just exist ‚Äì they thrive, align with national strategies, and drive innovation across the continent.


[^cover]: I covered all of these entities in my blogpost on the [Coordinated Plan for AI](/news/eu-and-research/).

Now, I know this still sounds abstract. So let‚Äôs bring it to life with a story.




### Lil‚ÄôBits: A Story of AI Innovation

You are the proud CEO of Lil‚ÄôBits, a cozy local restaurant that serves **extremely tiny portions** (you call it ‚Äúartisanal minimalism,‚Äù others call it ‚Äúeating air with a spoon.‚Äù). One day, you hear about an **EU Innovation Conference** happening nearby[^locality] and decide to check it out. Why not? Maybe AI can help you make those portions even smaller.

The conference is buzzing. Talks about AI‚Äôs potential are everywhere: efficiency this, accuracy that. By the end of the day, your brain feels like mush, but you‚Äôre intrigued. Over coffee, you strike up a conversation with someone from an **EDIH** ‚Äì a regional hub for AI adoption ‚Äì who‚Äôs thrilled to hear about Lil‚ÄôBits. He claims AI can revolutionize your business. "We can make your portions so small they‚Äôre invisible!" he says, only half-joking.

He then introduces you to a colleague from the local **AI Factory**, who assures you they have everything you need: **HPC resources, AI expertise**, and access to **consortium partnerships**. You nod politely, still skeptical, until the magic words hit: ‚Äú*AI-reduced culinary portions*‚Äù. 
Your eyes light up.




[^locality]: **European Digital Innovation Hubs (EDIHs)** are regional hubs specifically designed to address the needs of **local businesses**. Each EDIH focuses on its designated region, offering tailored support for **digital transformation**. For example, an SME in a rural area might lack the resources to experiment with AI ‚Äì but their local EDIH can provide access to **technology testing**, **training**, and even connections to European-level initiatives. The local focus ensures that innovation isn‚Äôt just centralized in big cities but reaches every corner of the EU.

##### A Trip to the AI Factory
Fast forward to a sunny spring morning. You find yourself at the gates of the **AI Factory campus**. It‚Äôs bustling with activity ‚Äì developers in hoodies, researchers in lab coats, and businesspeople who look like they just stepped off a plane. You think to yourself: *this is where the future happens*.

Your EDIH contact greets you and leads you through the facility. It‚Äôs a maze of rooms, each with its own purpose:
- **Server rooms** hum with the sound of supercomputers crunching data.
- **Co-working spaces** bring together developers, industry experts, and academics in lively discussions[^co-working-spaces].
- **Student areas** feel like modern dorms, with young talent working on exciting projects[^student-rooms].

Finally, you reach a sleek conference room, where a team of experts is waiting. You pitch your vision: "I want to make food portions even smaller ‚Äì smaller than anyone thought possible."

They love it. A woman from **business model development** explains how you could turn Lil‚ÄôBits into a global chain[^business-model]. Another expert from the **Agri-food EDIC**[^agri-food-edic] nods enthusiastically: "Micro-portions are revolutionary!" She mentions the **ShrinkiFood Innovation Hub**  and how they specialize in AI solutions for food minimization.

You pause. ‚ÄúBut do you even have the data to train a model for shrinking food?‚Äù

The expert grins. ‚ÄúFunny you ask. The AI Factory has access to a **Common European Data Space**[^data-space] for food innovation, where researchers and companies contribute high-quality datasets[^data-sharing]. Your dream of micro-sized dishes? The data you need is right here, sitting in our server room.‚Äù


[^co-working-spaces]: AI Factories are designed to foster **collaboration**. This includes **co-working spaces** where **industry professionals**, **researchers**, and **developers** work side-by-side. These shared spaces are meant to **break silos** and encourage knowledge exchange, ensuring that innovation happens where it‚Äôs needed most.


[^student-rooms]: The AI Factory is also a hub for **students and young talent**. Facilities often include dedicated **workspaces**, labs, and even dormitories where students can work on AI projects, develop new ideas, or participate in research collaborations. This setup is part of the EU‚Äôs long-term vision to **build AI skills** and **foster the next generation** of AI developers and researchers. 



[^business-model]: The **European Innovation Council ([EIC](https://eic.ec.europa.eu/index_en))** plays a role in supporting AI startups and SMEs. One of its key offerings is **business model development and acceleration services**. Through programs like the [EIC Accelerator](https://eic.ec.europa.eu/eic-funding-opportunities/bas_en), businesses receive support to **scale their operations**, attract investment, and access new markets. In the AI Factory context, EIC services could help a niche AI solution evolve into a scalable business model ‚Äì whether it‚Äôs shrinking food portions (√† la Lil‚ÄôBits) or developing cutting-edge AI tools for industry.


[^agri-food-edic]: The **Agri-food EDIC** is a [planned European Digital Infrastructure Consortium](https://ncpflanders.be/infosheets/european-digital-infrastructure-consortia-edics-under-digital-europe) focusing on **agriculture and food innovation**.  By collaborating with AI Factories, the Agri-food EDIC can ensure that agriculture-specific AI solutions get the compute power and expertise they need to thrive.


[^data-sharing]: Data sharing in an AI Factory is both a **natural consequence** of bringing together so many different actors ‚Äì startups, SMEs, researchers, and industry players ‚Äì and a **clear priority** for the EU. When you put all these people in one place with access to powerful infrastructure, sharing data becomes both **practical** and **incentivized**. Moreover, the **Data Act**, which I covered in detail in my [blogpost on the EU Data Strategy](/news/data-strategy/), actively pushes for secure and standardized data sharing between businesses (B2B), governments (G2B), and public sectors. 

[^data-space]: The **Common European Data Spaces** (CEDS) are collections of high-quality, purpose-driven datasets that serve specific sectors or applications.These datasets are designed to be **Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable** (FAIR principles), which makes them perfect raw material for training AI models. According to the AI Factory call, high-speed access to these spaces is **mandatory**, and hosting the data on-site is strongly encouraged. Why? Because it makes the factory a centralized hub for both data storage and AI development. Bonus points if access to the data is provided in a **trustworthy and secure way** ‚Äì think **[Gaia-X](https://gaia-x.eu/) federation** and similar EU-led data initiatives.  


##### The Inevitable Question
It all sounds too good to be true. You‚Äôre ecstatic, but doubts creep in. ‚ÄúWhat about regulations? I‚Äôve heard about the AI Act, and I‚Äôm pretty sure invisible food might break some rules‚Ä¶‚Äù

The room goes quiet. Finally, a representative from the **TEF for Agrifood Innovation** speaks up. He assures you they have facilities to **test and validate** AI systems under simulated, real-world conditions[^tef_food]. "We‚Äôll make sure your AI model meets all ethical and trustworthiness standards," he adds confidently[^trust_tef].



[^tef_food]: AI Factories must have strong ties to **Testing and Experimentation Facilities (TEFs)**, which play a crucial role in validating AI systems. TEFs are specialized environments (both physical and virtual) where AI solutions can be tested **under realistic conditions** before hitting the market. For example, if your AI system promises to optimize food production or, you know, *shrink portions to microscopic sizes*, the **Agrifood TEF** can simulate real-world agricultural and industrial settings to check if it actually works. This setup allows the AI Factory to focus on building and refining models while a **dedicated entity** (the TEF) handles testing and evaluation ‚Äì a beautiful division of labor.  

[^trust_tef]: At the moment, there‚Äôs no single TEF dedicated to **trustworthiness and ethical assessments** of AI systems ‚Äì which is a bit of a gap, considering the rapid pace of AI development and how quickly regulations like the AI Act are evolving. Trust and ethics are often tacked on as smaller components of broader TEF programs. Personally, I think there‚Äôs room for an **ad hoc TEF** specializing in ethical AI. Such a facility could focus exclusively on evaluating AI systems against fairness, transparency, and safety benchmarks, helping businesses navigate the tricky intersection of innovation and regulation.  


##### The Future is Small
You leave the meeting overwhelmed but inspired. With the help of the AI Factory, you can finally make your grandfather‚Äôs dream come true: serving food portions so small they‚Äôre practically theoretical. You shake hands with the team and walk out with a smile, imagining millions of satisfied customers worldwide eating a meal they swear they saw, if only for a moment[^ending].


[^ending]: Fast forward 30 years: you‚Äôre standing on stage, holding the prestigious [EY Entrepreneur of the Year award](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernst_%26_Young_Entrepreneur_of_the_Year_Award). The crowd cheers. Journalists swarm around you to get a glimpse of your groundbreaking achievement: the **plankton-sized pizza**. On the **[cover of Time magazine](/assets/images/news/plankton_pizza.png)**,  a dish so small it requires a magnifying glass to see. The caption reads: *‚ÄúSmaller than a Atom: The Plankton Pizza Revolution‚Äù*  



#### **Overview and Takeaways**  

Hopefully, the *Lil‚ÄôBits* story was entertaining (and absurd) enough to keep you reading, but more importantly, it illustrated a key point: an **AI Factory thrives on connections**.  

The purpose is to create a space where **startups, researchers, SMEs, public institutions**, and **industry players** can **collaborate and innovate**. These factories are designed to integrate into existing EU initiatives ‚Äì like EDIHs, EDICs, CEDS, and TEFs ‚Äì to ensure no one has to tackle AI challenges alone.  

While the story focused on SMEs (because who doesn‚Äôt want AI-optimized culinary portions?), the **AI Factory ecosystem** serves a much broader range of users:  
- **Researchers and Academics** can leverage HPC resources, datasets, and training to drive AI research.  
- **Public Sector Organizations** benefit from AI adoption expertise offered through EDIHs.  
- **Startups and SMEs** gain access to business accelerators (like the EIC), data, and infrastructure to scale their AI solutions.  
- **Large Industry Players** can collaborate with experts and access advanced resources for AI development and training.  

The key takeaway? AI Factories bring these groups together under one roof, providing the tools, knowledge, and physical space needed to turn ideas into real-world solutions.

And let‚Äôs not forget: **skills and education** are at the heart of this ecosystem. AI Factories will play a critical role in training the next generation of AI developers and researchers, ensuring that Europe remains competitive in the global AI race.  


# Types of Factories Tracks

Now that we‚Äôve covered what an AI Factory does and why it matters, let‚Äôs look at how they‚Äôre actually implemented. Because, as impressive as these hubs of innovation sound, **not all AI Factories are built from scratch**. The EU proposal splits AI Factories into **three tracks**, depending on how ‚Äúready-to-go‚Äù your infrastructure already is.

You can think of it like renovating a house:

- **Track 1**: Use what you‚Äôve got ‚Äì a quick clean-up and some new furniture.
- **Track 2**: Give the place a serious upgrade ‚Äì new floors, walls, and appliances.
- **Track 3**: Build from the ground up ‚Äì lay the foundation, choose a plot of land, and go full architect mode.

Here‚Äôs a quick breakdown:



| Track                            | Description                               | EU Contribution           |
|---------------------------------|------------------------------------------|---------------------------|
| (1) AI Factories Track              | Use existing EuroHPC systems.            | Partial funding for costs.|
| (2) Upgraded Supercomputer Track    | Upgrade existing EuroHPC infrastructure. | Covers upgrade costs.     |
| (3) New AI Supercomputer Track      | Build new AI-optimized infrastructure.   | Highest funding allocation.|

---




## ‚ÄúAI Factories‚Äù Track 
This track is the **fastest and least construction-heavy option**. If you already have a EuroHPC supercomputer humming away in your facility, you can apply to have it **appointed as an AI Factory**.

The requirements are relatively straightforward: you need to prove that your system has enough computing resources to handle the train general-purpose AI models.

The call doesn‚Äôt spell out strict benchmarks, but we can make some educated guesses:
- Computing Power: Your system will likely be judged on existing benchmarks like [HPL-MxP](https://hpl-mxp.org/) or [MLPerf Training](https://github.com/mlcommons/training), which measure HPC performance.
- Time-to-Solution: Another measure is the time it takes to train a specific large language model, for example, training a 10-billion parameter model within 45 days.

If you meet these requirements, congratulations ‚Äì you‚Äôve got yourself an AI Factory. Just make sure you cover all the activities we discussed earlier (data, models, expertise) to keep the ‚Äúfactory‚Äù running smoothly.


## Upgraded AI Optimised Supercomputer Track

If you already have a EuroHPC supercomputer, but it‚Äôs not quite **AI Factory-ready**, this is your track. Here, you don‚Äôt just **appoint** a system ‚Äì you** upgrade it** with enhanced AI capabilities.

This track adds a little more work to the mix. In addition to meeting all the usual AI Factory requirements, you need to:

1. **Specify the Upgrades**: Show exactly what improvements are needed ‚Äì for example, new GPUs, additional storage, or faster networking.
2. **Prove Eligibility**: Outline how these upgrades will make the system capable of hosting AI Factory activities.

## AI Optimised Supercomputer Track

Finally we get to the big one. 
This track involves **acquiring a brand-new AI-optimized supercomputer** and setting up the infrastructure to host the factory. It‚Äôs also the most complex, for obvious reasons:
- You need to find the **perfect location** ‚Äì balancing factors like cooling efficiency, energy availability, and connectivity[^choosing_location].
- If you‚Äôre working with a consortium (which you probably are), get ready for a tug-of-war between partners, since everyone will want the factory in their country. It brings prestige, jobs, and economic benefits ‚Äì but also hefty responsibilities.



[^choosing_location]: Supercomputer site selection involves balancing factors like [energy cost and availability](https://www.wired.com/story/big-tech-data-centers-cheap-energy?), climate for [cooling efficiency](https://www.datacenterknowledge.com/data-center-site-selection/5-factors-to-consider-when-selecting-a-data-center-location?), and [connectivity to high-speed networks](https://www.datacenters.com/news/considerations-for-data-center-site-selection?). [Risk of natural disasters](https://datacentercatalog.com/news/2023/10-data-center-location-strategy-considerations?) and [regulatory incentives](https://www.wired.com/story/big-tech-data-centers-cheap-energy?) also play key roles, alongside [proximity to talent pools and end-users](https://blog.equinix.com/blog/2024/08/06/5-considerations-for-choosing-data-center-locations/?). Sustainability is critical, focusing on [renewable energy and green cooling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_center?), as is [scalability](https://www.flexential.com/resources/blog/essential-considerations-effective-data-center-site-selection?) for future growth.

# Budgets: What Does the EU Cover?

Now that we‚Äôve covered the types of AI Factory tracks and their activities, let‚Äôs take a closer look at **how the EU plans to fund them**.

First things first, the **AI Factory initiative** draws on significant funding from the **multiannual financial framework (2021-2027)**, which prioritizes the development and deployment of digital technologies, including AI.  

Here‚Äôs how funding is structured:  
- **[Horizon Europe](https://research-and-innovation.ec.europa.eu/funding/funding-opportunities/funding-programmes-and-open-calls/horizon-europe_en)**: Focuses on R&D&I projects and scaling up AI startups.  
- **[Digital Europe Programme](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/activities/digital-programme)**: Expected to be the primary framework supporting AI Factories by funding technology deployment and training.  
- **EuroHPC**: As part of the AI Innovation Package, the amendment to the EuroHPC regulation has made AI Factories a new priority in terms of investments.

Funding will also come from **member states and private companies** to complement EU contributions.

In summary, the EU covers **up to 50% of acquisition, operation, and upgrade costs** for AI Factories, while member states and private partners fund the remainder.

This also translates in different allocation for the tracks:

| **Track**                                    | **EU Contribution**                                                                                     | **Hosting Entity Responsibility**                  |
|---------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| **Existing EuroHPC Supercomputing Systems as AI Factories Track** | Up to 50% of operational costs                                                                         | Remainder of operational costs                    |
| **Upgraded AI Optimised Supercomputer Track**                  | Up to 50% of acquisition costs for upgrades (depreciated lifetime), Up to 35% of additional operating costs | Remainder of acquisition and operating costs      |
| **New AI-Optimized Supercomputer Track**                      | Up to 50% of acquisition costs for new supercomputers, Up to 50% of operating costs                    | Remainder of acquisition and operating costs      |



# National Strategy and Networking

To maximize their impact, AI Factories must **align closely with the national AI strategies** of the hosting country or consortium of countries. Applicants are expected to outline:
- **National AI Strategy Linkage**: Describe how the AI Factory integrates into and advances the objectives outlined in the hosting country‚Äôs national AI strategy.
- **National Data Policies**: Provide an overview of the current national data policies, including access to large datasets and knowledge corpora, with a focus on open, FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) data[^absent_policy].
- **National Access Policy for AI Community**: Applicants should develop user-friendly access policies for allocating national computing time on EuroHPC supercomputers. 

The task is no small feat. It requires knowing the **national AI landscape **inside out and finding ways to integrate the factory‚Äôs goals with the broader ecosystem. Done right, the AI Factory becomes the nucleus for AI innovation ‚Äì building momentum, fostering collaboration, and benefiting everything around it.

[^absent_policy]: If no policy exist, the applicants must present a clear plan for making large datasets accessible to the AI Factory ecosystem! This includes mechanisms for accessing proprietary data with potential fee schemes for AI training, fine-tuning, and inference.


## AI Factory coordination

So, let‚Äôs say you‚Äôve set up your AI Factory. You‚Äôve got the hardware, the datasets, and a steady stream of users. But there‚Äôs still one big question: **how do these factories coordinate with each other?**

The call for proposals and its amendment outline several strategies for collaboration:
- **Knowledge Sharing**: Factories are expected to share best practices, lessons learned, and technical expertise, ensuring everyone benefits from what works (and what doesn‚Äôt).
- **Specialization**: Each AI Factory should carve out a specific domain or expertise ‚Äì this avoids duplicating efforts and maximizes efficiency.
- **Asset Reutilization**: Sharing tools, datasets, or even specific resources across factories to make the most of existing investments.
- **Support and Training**: Factories will collaborate on programs to train AI professionals, organize workshops, and upskill users.
- **Staff Exchange**: Facilitating staff exchanges to promote knowledge transfer, collaboration, and cross-pollination of ideas.
- **Homogeneous End-to-End User Experience**: For projects spanning multiple factories, the experience should be seamless and consistent for users, no matter where they access resources.

These are all great strategies on paper. They encourage cooperation, reduce redundancy, and create a networked AI ecosystem where everyone shares the benefits. But here‚Äôs where I get a little skeptical.

The EuroHPC Joint Undertaking (JU) is tasked with **overseeing these coordination efforts** ‚Äì facilitating networks, developing standards, and ensuring alignment between factories. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, this is a well-thought-out approach. But the EuroHPC JU already has a **ton of responsibilities** on its plate, from managing supercomputing projects to supporting HPC innovation across Europe. Adding ‚Äúcoordinate the AI Factories‚Äù on top of that feels like it might stretch their capacity thin.

This is just my take, of course, but I can‚Äôt help wondering: **is this enough?** Later on, I‚Äôll suggest a few alternatives.


# Conclusion

Here we are, at the end of another blog post. This one has been especially close to my heart because it touches on something fundamental: centralizing AI resources while fostering innovation across Europe. The AI Factories initiative is ambitious, and if done right, it could be a game-changer for Europe‚Äôs AI ecosystem.

For those who skipped straight to the bottom (no hard feelings), here‚Äôs a quick summary.
Here‚Äôs the final, polished version of the **Conclusion**, complete with a filled-out summary and improved flow. I‚Äôve kept your style intact, added clarity, and ensured the section ties everything together neatly.  

## Summary 

The AI Factories are Europe‚Äôs bold bet on scaling up AI infrastructure and innovation:  
- They act as **one-stop shops** for startups, SMEs, researchers, and public-sector users to access **supercomputing resources, datasets, and expertise**.  
- They are designed to be **interconnected** with existing EU initiatives, such as European Digital Innovation Hubs (EDIHs), European Digital Infrastructure Consortiums (EDICs), Common European Data Spaces (CEDS), and Testing and Experimentation Facilities (TEFs), ensuring alignment and collaboration across the continent.
- Factories are implemented through **three tracks**: appointing existing EuroHPC systems, upgrading current infrastructure, or building new AI-optimized supercomputers.  
- Funding comes from **Horizon Europe**, the **Digital Europe Programme**, and the **EuroHPC Joint Undertaking**, with up to **50% of costs covered** by the EU.  
- AI Factories must align with **national AI strategies** and integrate into broader EU initiatives like EDIHs, EDICs, and TEFs to maximize their impact.  
- Coordination between factories remains a challenge, as the EuroHPC JU is tasked with managing this, despite its already heavy workload.  

While the initiative has tremendous potential, a few questions remain:  
- **Who ensures effective coordination?**  
- **Can competition between factories drive even more innovation?**  
- **How can secure and trustworthy data/model access be implemented?**  

## Open Questions and Suggestions

### Coordination Between Factories  

One of the main concerns I have is the **coordination challenge**. The EuroHPC JU is currently tasked with supervising and connecting AI Factories, but this feels like adding too much weight to an already full plate.  

So, what could be done differently?  

1. **Factory-Level Coordination Groups**:  
   Each AI Factory could be required to establish a dedicated **coordination group** responsible for networking with other factories. Their progress could be evaluated through specific **KPIs** (Key Performance Indicators), ensuring that collaboration and knowledge sharing don‚Äôt fall through the cracks.  

   While this decentralized approach gives factories more autonomy, it‚Äôs not explicit in the current setup. Making it a formal requirement could make a big difference.  

2. **A Centralized Coordination Entity (CERN4AI)**:  
   Alternatively, I remain a firm believer in creating a **superseding entity** ‚Äì call it *CERN for AI*, if you like. The AI Office is currently the closest thing to this idea, but it‚Äôs stretched thin with responsibilities like developing standards and aligning with the AI Act.  

   A dedicated entity focused **solely** on coordinating AI Factories could provide the oversight and direction needed to ensure these hubs work together effectively. This could be the missing piece to make Europe‚Äôs AI efforts truly cohesive.  



### What About Competition?**

It‚Äôs well-documented that [competition fuels innovation](https://www.oecd.org/en/publications/competition-and-innovation-a-theoretical-perspective_4632227c-en.html)[^competition]. But looking at the current setup, we don‚Äôt see much competition between AI Factories.  

Here‚Äôs an idea: **introduce healthy competition through challenges**.  

- Factories (or groups of factories) could compete on specific **AI-related projects** with clear, measurable KPIs.  
- To ensure fairness, introduce one or two **secret benchmarks** to evaluate outcomes.  
- Periodic evaluations could filter out underperforming projects while rewarding the best ones.  

The rewards? Successful factories could receive additional funding, favorable conditions from EuroHPC JU, or even priority access to resources. This would drive innovation, foster collaboration, and create incentives to **push boundaries**.  

Competition doesn‚Äôt have to mean isolation. In fact, it could encourage factories to form alliances, share expertise, and strive for excellence. After all, who doesn‚Äôt love a bit of friendly rivalry?  

### Ensuring Connectivity and Data Access

The proposal and amendment require that AI Factories be connected via two networks:  

- **EuroHPC Hyper-Connectivity Network**: This ensures high-speed data transfer and efficient communication between AI Factories across Europe.  
- **GEANT Network**: As part of the pan-European research and education network, this connection allows AI Factories to integrate closely with academic and research institutions.

While these connectivity measures are clear, the documents remain vague on **how data access** should be implemented. Factories are expected to retrieve data from **Common European Data Spaces** or secure, trusted repositories. On one hand, this flexibility avoids imposing a one-size-fits-all solution. On the other, it raises questions about **standardization** and interoperability.  

This is where frameworks like **Gaia-X** could play a significant role. [Gaia-X](https://gaia-x.eu/) promotes **federated access** to shared resources, prioritizing privacy, security, and trustworthiness ‚Äì all fundamental requirements for AI Factories.  

I believe implementing **a standardized yet flexible approach** inspired by Gaia-X would greatly benefit AI Factories. 

While it‚Äôs still too early to say if this will happen, I‚Äôm optimistic. We‚Äôve seen the rise of federated access systems across the EU, and AI Factories are the perfect opportunity to adopt such standards. By doing so, Europe can ensure its AI infrastructure is not only powerful but also **secure, interoperable, and future-proof**.  


### Final Thoughts 

The AI Factories initiative is an ambitious move to centralize Europe‚Äôs AI efforts, address resource fragmentation, and provide real opportunities for innovation. It‚Äôs a bold bet ‚Äì and while the framework is promising, there are still challenges to overcome.  

From improving coordination to exploring competition as a driver of innovation, there‚Äôs room for improvement. But if Europe gets this right, AI Factories could become the cornerstone of its AI strategy, transforming ideas into solutions that benefit everyone.  

Let‚Äôs keep an eye on how this unfolds ‚Äì I, for one, will be watching closely.  

[^competition]: This applies when "the market is contestable, in the sense that innovators can successfully escape competition, and whether the innovation is appropriable, meaning that successful innovators can capture the benefit from innovation, at least temporarily."
