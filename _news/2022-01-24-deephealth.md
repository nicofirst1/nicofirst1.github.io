Intense week in which the combination of lectures and lab exercises will bring participants 
(1) closer to the use of deep learning and computer vision in tasks related to medical imaging and other medical data, and 
(2) to high-performance computing to considerably reduce the running times of model-training processes.

Topics: Deep Learning, Computer Vision, Medical Imaging and High-Performance Computing
