In the [previous post](https://nicofirst1.github.io/news/horizon-fragmentation/) we figured out that the Horizon Europe project contains some redundancies in (AI-related) project. My next step was to try and figure out how to suggest a fix to this problem, but in order to do so I had to dig deep in how EU handles AI projects and agendas. 
I started easy, asking chatgpt to provide a list of EU  policies/organizations and whatever related to AI. Of course the first one was the [EU AI Act](https://www.europarl.europa.eu/topics/en/article/20230601STO93804/eu-ai-act-first-regulation-on-artificial-intelligence) which I'm now familiar with and this just made me cocky in thinking I was already an expert in this. 
Well, the second suggestion was the [Coordinated Plan on Artificial Intelligence (PlanAI)](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/plan-ai). It's just a plan, how complicated can it be? 
Well, let's just say the rabit hole was deeper than expected. 

So, join me in this journey of dead-links and never-ending references. With this post (probably the first of a series), we'll sviscerate the PlanAI and see how many projects are connected to it. 
If you prefer a visual approach, I made this [nice graph](https://nicofirst1.github.io/euai_graph) where all these initiatives are connected and can be interacted with. The graph will be continuously updated so don't worry if some info is missing right now. 

Well, let's begin.


# Coordinated Plan on Artificial Intelligence
The PlanAI was first published in 2018 and then [reviewed in 2021](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/library/coordinated-plan-artificial-intelligence-2021-review) when the EU (and the world) realized the potential that AI can have. 
The changes between the two versions are mainly in the direction of:

- Planning: the 2021 version put an emphasis on human-centric, sustainable and secure AI. It also aims to achieve EU digital sovereignty.
- Funding: the main difference. The original plan was to invest at least €20 billion by 2020 using the Horizon 2020 and Horizon EU. The new plan upped the number quite a bit and amies now for €145 billion by 2023 using the Horizon EU, the [Digital Europe Programme](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/activities/digital-programme) and the [Recovery and Resilience Facility](https://next-generation-eu.europa.eu/recovery-and-resilience-facility_en).
- Funding: the main difference. The original plan was to invest at least €20 billion by 2020 using the Horizon 2020 and Horizon EU. The new plan upped the number quite a bit and amies now for €145 billion by 2023 using the Horizon EU, the [Digital Europe Programme](ht
- tps://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/activities/digital-programme) and the [Recovery and Resilience Facility](https://next-generation-eu.europa.eu/recovery-and-resilience-facility_en).

For everything else, the new PlanAI is based on 4 policies reflecting key objectives in AI. 


## 1. Enabling conditions for AI’s development and uptake
Let's abbreviate it to [EnablingAI](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/enabling-ai).
Here the aim is to actually have the resources necessary to have AI in EU. This translates in starting two new initiatives: AI Factories and GenAI4EU.

### AI Factories
[Announced in Jan 2024](https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_24_383), The AI Factories will come to life in 2025 and are (for now), just an [amend](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/news/setting-ai-factories-now-possible-after-eurohpc-regulation-amendment) to the [The European High Performance Computing Joint Undertaking (EuroHPC JU)](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/high-performance-computing-joint-undertaking). 
So, for now, we only have a vague description of what a factory will look like. Specifically it will include a mix of hardware (supercomputer and data centers), "human capital" (I guess they mean experts from academia and research institutes) and startups/SMEs. 

But how?
Well, the commission and member states will invest an additional €2.1 billion to acquire more compute. On top of that the commission will provide financial support for startups (min €100 million) with a cap of €1 billion coming from [InvestEU](https://investeu.europa.eu/index_en).

### GenAI4EU
Honestly I couldn't find much on what these are supposed to be. The description is "aims to support the development of novel use cases and emerging applications in Europe's 14 industrial ecosystems, as well as the public sector. Application areas include robotics, health, biotech, manufacturing, mobility, climate and virtual worlds." 
What I could find is that the commission is planning to use the Horizon Europe and the Digital Europe programmes to fund projects that are connected to industry application of GenAI (in the above field) for a total of €500 million[^1].
Also these initiatives will cooperate with the AI Factories and the [Common European Data Spaces](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/data-spaces). I guess the latter will provide compute/experts and the former data.
Finally, the [EU AI Office](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/ai-office) toghether with the [European Transition Pathways Platform will](https://single-market-economy.ec.europa.eu/industry/transition-pathways_en) monitor GenAI4EU's progress. 


[^1]: [Euractive article](https://www.euractiv.com/section/artificial-intelligence/news/leak-eu-commission-prepares-strategic-framework-to-boost-ai-start-ups-generative-ai-uptake/). I can't access the [science business one](https://sciencebusiness.net/news/r-d-funding/commission-shaping-eu500m-generative-artificial-intelligence-calls) :(

## 2. Thriving from the lab to the market
While point 1. was busy with describing the material necessities to build AI (mainly compute and experts), the [aiLabMarket](https://diorganisationsgital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/ai-lab-market) focuses on fostering Puplic-Private-Partnerships (PPP). Specifically, the commission will provide a €1 billion per year investments in AI coming from our friends: Horizon Europe and the Digital Europe. Another €20 billions will be provided from Member states and the private sector. Finally The whole thing can use [The Recovery and Resilience Facility (RRF)](https://commission.europa.eu/business-economy-euro/economic-recovery/recovery-and-resilience-facility_en) funds [^2], which amount to €134 billions.

[^2]: The RRF allocated the €134 billions for project that aim to digitalize the EU. So these funds are not directly and only allocated to AI initiatives, however it is the case that AI initiatives are contained in the aim.

Of course, to do so you need to intervene in various aspects:
- The actual coordination between experts (academia) and private sector -> Enter [The AI,Data and Robotic Association (ADRA)](https://adr-association.eu/) (more about it later).
- What happens when ADRA is not enough? If you are a small player with a big idea, you can just hop on the  [AI-on-demand platform (AIoD)](https://www.ai4europe.eu/) and check what kind of available resources (algorithms, data and compute) you can use for your goals! 
- Just to be sure, let's also add a network of [European Digital Innovation Hubs (EDIHs)](https://european-digital-innovation-hubs.ec.europa.eu/home) which can help on a **regional-level**.
- How do you coordinate between experts and private sector if you have no experts? Well, you need a network of (academic) organizations that foster AI research of course -> that's why the [European Networks of Excellence in AI (NoEs)](https://www.vision4ai.eu/community/)  exits.
- Ok, you have the experts and the private partners. They come up with a nice idea and implement it. Will it be in line with the never-ending, always-changing EU regulations? Why don't you try your idea out in the newly created [testing and experimentation facilities (TEFs)](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/activities/testing-and-experimentation-facilities)!


In the next parts, we will check each of these points out. 


###  AI, Data and Robotics Association (ADRA)
As mentioned before, ADRA is an association with the aim of promoting PPP by accessing €2.6 billion euros from the Horizon 2020 and Horizon Europe funds (and additional contributions by [private partners](https://adr-association.eu/why-join-adra)). It's called association right? So who are the members? Well, the initial ones were: 
1. [Big Data Value Association (BDVA)](https://bdva.eu/)
2. [Confederation of Laboratories for Artificial Intelligence Research in Europe (CLAIRE)](https://claire-ai.org/)
3. [European Laboratory for Learning and Intelligent Systems (ELLIS)](https://ellis.eu/)
4. [European Association for Artificial Intelligence (EurAI)](https://www.eurai.org/)
5. [European Robotic Forum (euRobotics)](https://eu-robotics.net/)

Hopefully, we'll have time and energies to figure out where these guys come from later. As now (06/10/2024) there are a total of 140 Members: 88 Research, 47 industry, 4 associate (?) and 1 strategic (Sweden AI). Not bad considering the project is 3 years old (created in May 2021) and they managed to get big players on board (e.g. BMW, Decathlon, Bosch...).

##### Goals

Going back the ADRA's goals, as stated in the [Partnership Proposal](https://adr-association.eu/sites/default/files/2024-04/Partnership-application-2020-submitted.pdf) they have 3 *general objectives* divided in 7 specific ones (see Figure, ADRA plz don't sue me for sing your picture)
![ADRA objectives](/assets/images/news/eu_landscape/adra_objectives.png)

Apart from the usual suspects (securing European sovereignty), we can see a specific aim in promoting the creation of innovative[^3] initiatives[^4] aimed at maximizing societal[^5] and economical[^6] benefits. To me, it seems that ADRA has the most challenging objective of balancing EU values for societal benefits (no risky upcases), with regulatory/market fragmentation and uncertainty, with companies objectives. Good luck.

[^3]: Innovative in the sense that the idea most likely originates from an academic context.
[^4]: The private sector part of the idea. Here the aim is to guide the private sector offering expertise in both the technical (the previous point) and the regulatory part.
[^5]: Societal and environmental will have to align with the strict EU regulations and AI ACT. This will prevent the implementation of risky AI upcases. 
[^6]: Companies chase money -> AI can make money. 


##### How?
ADRA's proposal ([Section 3](https://adr-association.eu/sites/default/files/2024-04/Partnership-application-2020-submitted.pdf)) lists a number of activities in order to achieve its goals.

Basically they can be divided in support for innovation (lighthouses, mission-based challenges, cascade actions, actions to simulate uptake and market/innovation enablers) or for ecosystems (community building, business models/organizations, regulation/standards and taskforce)

##### Current status
Currently, ADRA released the fourth edition of the[Strategic Research, Innovation, and Deployment Agenda (SRIDA)](https://adr-association.eu/news/adra-releases-strategic-research-innovation-and-deployment-agenda)  where they outline "the long-term vision for the development and deployment of trustworthy AI, Data, and Robotics technologies in Europe and provides key recommendations to guide future European work programs.".
I highly suggest to read it.
ADRA also has a series of forum going on, the latest being [last November](https://adr-association.eu/news/announcing-european-ai-data-robotics-forum-4-5-november-2024) (i missed it!).



### AI-on-demand platform (AIoD)
While ADRA actively put effort in connecting public and primate sector, it cannot materially help all possible Small Medium sized Enterprises (SMEs).  For these, a federated approach is more appropriate, meaning that they need to help themselves. How can they do that? How can **you**, with a nice business idea, look around and see what others are offering (algorithm, data, compute, expertise) and use those resources to your advantage?
Well, have you heard of the [AI-on-demand platform](https://aiod.eu/)?

Apart from having the slowest website ever which seems to be created by a particularly skilled 15 old teen, the platform is host of several services:
- An assets catalogue, aka [MyLibrary](https://mylibrary.aiod.eu/marketplace) where you can get access to AI models, datasets and experiments. On the dataset parts it seems to have only stuff from Hugging Face, while the models seems to come from [Bonseyes](https://www.bonseyes.eu/) (a marketplace for AI in cloud and edge) and [OpenML](https://www.openml.org/) (another platform for AI stuff). It also says "powered by AI4Eosc" which stands for [Artificial Intelligence for the European Open Science Cloud](https://ai4eosc.eu/) ([todo](https://ai4eosc.eu/) add to graph).
- [Research Bundles](https://www.ai4europe.eu/research/research-bundles) : give you a space in the AI on-demand platform where you can collect and publish the outputs of a small research project in a compact way. A research bundle collects in a single place all the assets (code, data, tutorials, examples, ...) produced by your project and published on the AI on-demand platform. Of course, you can also put links to assets published elsewhere, like Github or Zenodo.
- An [AI builder](https://aiexp.ai4europe.eu/#/home) in partnership with Eclispe built at Fraunhofer IAIS (wink wink).
- [Research and Innovation AI Lab (RAIL)](https://rail.aiod.eu/docs/about) a beta version of what seems to be an educational oriented platform to use AioD assets.


Speaking of funds, the platform is supported by Horizon 2020, Horizon Europe, and Digital Europe programme (focus on industry and public administration), but I couldn't find any specific numbers. 


###  European Digital Innovation Hubs (EDIHs)

So, if you got this far, you know know that: if you're a big company, ADRA will carry your hand through the EU regulations[^7] and if you're small but independent, that you can check what's the AIoD has to offer. 

[^7]: As we saw before ADRA does much more, but stick with me for this example. 

What happens when mamma ADRA has no time for you and you don't understand what AIoD is about (I feel you)?
In this case, you can run towards the closest [European Digital Innovation Hubs (EDIHs)](https://european-digital-innovation-hubs.ec.europa.eu/home). EDIHs are **regional** hubs that promote digitalization for both the [public](https://european-digital-innovation-hubs.ec.europa.eu/knowledge-hub/thematic-groups/public-administration-main-focus-artificial-intelligence) and private sectors. There are currently [150 working in AI](https://european-digital-innovation-hubs.ec.europa.eu/edih-catalogue) and their objectives are defined on the website as "EDIHs help all companies seeking to use AI technologies to become more competitive on business/production processes, products or services."
If we choose a [random one](https://european-digital-innovation-hubs.ec.europa.eu/edih-catalogue/edih-rheinland-website) from the catalog we see how they mostly provide support(check the [services](https://european-digital-innovation-hubs.ec.europa.eu/edih-catalogue/edih-rheinland-website/services)).
While 50% of their costs are funded by the EU and member states, the remaining needs to be covered by private contributions and reginal funding. I like this approach because it forces the EDIH to be active on a regional level, hopefully solving (small but very real) problems.

On the website several more initiatives are presented, I will just give a brief list here and we will see if they pop out again:
- [Digital Transformation Accelerator (DTA)](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/funding/digital-transformation-accelerator-network-edih-cnect2021op0004): a project that aims to support the creation, development, and growth of the pan-European DIH network, and facilitate intra/inter-regional collaboration between EDIHs. It finished in March 2022
-  [Digital Maturity Assessment Tool (DMAT)](https://european-digital-innovation-hubs.ec.europa.eu/open-dma): Developed by the European Commission Joint Research Centre (JRC), it is a framework to measure maturity  EDIH customers across Europe.
-  [Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)](https://road-safety.transport.ec.europa.eu/european-road-safety-observatory/data-and-analysis/key-performance-indicators-kpis_en):  it is a reporting tool used by EDIH to report their progress to the commission.


###  Networks of Excellence Centres (NoEs)

Until now, we covered the initiatives dedicated to realizing the innovations brought to life by experts. But what do you bring to life with no experts? 

That's why the [Networks of Excellence Centres (NoEs)](https://www.vision4ai.eu/community/) exists. The attentive reader will see that the link for NoEs is actually redirecting to the Vision4Ai website. Digging around I found that the [VISION project](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/952070) was given ~ €2 million from Horizon 2020, and it lasted from September 1st 2020 until this August (31st, 2024). Its main objective was to coordinate the NoEs which they seem to have accomplished. 
So, now it is unclear to me who will take on the task of coordinating the NoEs, but it also might be the case that this is not needed anymore as the centers are already in contact with each other. 

Speaking of centers, these are the current ones:

| Start Year 	|                                      	|                                            	|                                            	|                                      	|
|------------	|--------------------------------------	|--------------------------------------------	|--------------------------------------------	|--------------------------------------	|
| 2020       	| [AI4media](https://www.ai4media.eu/) 	| [ELISE](https://www.elise-ai.eu/)[^8]          	| [Humane-AI net](https://www.humane-ai.eu/) 	| [TAILOR](https://tailor-network.eu/) 	|
| 2022       	| [ELSA](https://elsa-ai.eu/)          	| [euROBIN](https://www.eurobin-project.eu/) 	|                                            	|                                      	|
| 2023       	| [ELIAS](https://elias-ai.eu/)        	| [dAIedge](https://daiedge.eu/)             	| [Enfield](https://www.enfield-project.eu/) 	|                                      	|                         |


[^8]: Fun fact, ELISE it used to be called European Learning and Intelligent Systems Excellence ([according to the proposal](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/951847)).


Where all the ones started in 2020 have ended this August. 


NoEs reports to be strongly linked to ADRA and wants all the projects to communicate via the  [AI-on-demand platform (AIoD)](https://www.ai4europe.eu/) platform.

As previously said, the focus here is mainly academic: "fostering research excellence and creating a critical mass of European AI knowledge and talent".


### Testing and experimentation facilities (TEFs)

We've come to the last one, finally. For you it's a 10 min read, but I've been digging around for days now...
The last piece of aiLabMarket, is related to the last step in the line: testing. 
For this purpose, the commission invested €200 million to create 4 sectorial [Testing and Experimentation Facilities (TEFs) for AI.](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/activities/testing-and-experimentation-facilities), specifically for:
- Healthcare with [TEF-Health](https://tefhealth.eu/home)
- Agri-food with [AgrifoodTEF](https://www.agrifoodtef.eu/)
- Manufacturing with [AI Matters](https://ai-matters.eu/)
- Smart Cities & Communities with [Citcom.ai](https://citcom.ai/?trk=article-ssr-frontend-pulse_little-text-block)

But what are these facilities? How is testing performed? Let's see.
We'll take Citcom as an example since it relates to a filed I'm more or less familiar with (smart-cities).
By looking and their website, we can see that they offer [several services](https://citcom.ai/services) ranging from access to data too testing in real life situation (you can [deploy your system in belgium](https://citcom.ai/services/deploy-and-test-traffic-solution-in-a-real-life-traffic-environment)). All of these services have a [Technology Rediness Level](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology_readiness_level) (TRL) threshold of 6 to 8, meaning that your system needs to be at least demonstrated in a relevant environment. 

Overall TEFs are not so complex. They are places where you can bring your system to be tested in a close-to-final environment. The official EU page also mention that, after the 5 years funding, the TEFs are expected "to achieve long-term financial sustainability", which probably mean that as a company you need to pay for these services. And since you need to test your system to deploy it on a EU level, this will become a must for the companies willing to bring their products to the EU. The real question is : will the additional costs of testing be transferred to the end user (us)?



## 3. Ensuring that AI works for people (AI-People)

To recap (I need this more than you):  EnablingAI focuses on supporting the creation of "physical" AI stuff (e.g. compute centers), aiLabMarket focuses instead of creating synergies between innovation (e.g. research), the market (SMEs) and the public sector (PPP).  
So what's left? Well, society!

The third policy pillar is [ensuring that AI works for people](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/ai-people) (which we will abbreviate with *aiPeople*). This pillar covers all the parts related to: (i) educating/training people on AI (this includes [keeping experts from fleeing to the US](https://op.europa.eu/en/publication-detail/-/publication/9e39b4bd-843c-11ee-99ba-01aa75ed71a1/language-en)), (ii) keeping society afloat, (iii) and making EU a leader in AI regulations. 

To really understand what these guys are about, we need to first "partire per la tangente" and introduce the EU digital Strategy\|Decade\|Programme\|Compass (yes these are all different things, and there are more[^9]).

[^9]: I made it a challenge with myself to find as many initiatives that start with digital. Here is a decently not complete list: (1) [Digital Economy and Society Index](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/desi), (2) [Digital Services Act](https://commission.europa.eu/strategy-and-policy/priorities-2019-2024/europe-fit-digital-age/digital-services-act_en), (3) [Digital Markets Act](https://commission.europa.eu/strategy-and-policy/priorities-2019-2024/europe-fit-digital-age/digital-markets-act-ensuring-fair-and-open-digital-markets_en), (4) [Digital Agenda for Europe](https://www.europarl.europa.eu/factsheets/en/sheet/64/digital-agenda-for-europe),(5) [Digital Action Day](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/library/digital-action-day-report), (6) [Digital Euro](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/euro/digital_euro/html/index.en.html)


##### EU Digital ***
So, let's start with the [European Digital Strategy (EDS)](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en). The EDS is the superset/umbrella under which all the other digital stuff reside. It was first introduced in 2020 in [this press release](https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_20_416) as a successor to the [Digital Agenda](https://www.europarl.europa.eu/factsheets/en/sheet/64/digital-agenda-for-europe) and has BIIIG objectives. Among those, the one that I'm most excited for is the "single digital market" which addressed the fragmentation problem we discussed in here and in previous posts. 

In March 2021, the commission [proposed](https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/api/files/document/print/en/qanda_21_4631/QANDA_21_4631_EN.pdf) the [Digital Decade (DigiDec)](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/europes-digital-decade) as a structured policy programme to implements the goals of the EDS. So basically the EDS had big plans and the DigiDec layout a way to achieve them. However the DigiDec is still not accurate enough, e.g. it does not provide metrics in order to measure if the goals are achieved. 

Enter the [Digital Compass (DigiCompass)](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/en/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A52021DC0118).
If you clicked on the link for the DigiCompass, you will notice that it is one of those boring, long EU commission document. This document is where all the metrics and objectives from the DigiDec are defined. If you have time to waste, you can scroll all the way down to the annex, where you'll see a table of "cardinal points", aka objectives. Among those we finally see something related to AI, mainly:
- At least 20 million (against the current 7.8 million) employed Information and Communications Technology (ICT) specialists, some of which will be in AI. 
- At least 20% word production in value for semiconductors, cough cough AI factories.
- At least 75% of European enterprises have taken up AI

Ok, all very cool, but where is the money coming from? You might have guessed that the last piece of the puzzle is indeed the [Digital Europe Programme (DigiProg)](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/activities/digital-programme). You don't know, but we have encountered this friend already. It has a budget of €7.9 billion and it is the responsible for the financing of EDIH, GenAI4EU and AIoD.



### Nurturing talent and improving skills
Basically they want to create and KEEP talents in AI in Europe.  They want to do so by: 
- Supporting traineeships in digital areas. They cite the [Digital Education Action Plan (DEAP)](https://education.ec.europa.eu/focus-topics/digital-education/action-plan) but it is unclear to which of the 13 articles this refers to. Or if the DEAP is part ot the coordinated plan (unlikely)
- Launch a call for specialised education programmes and courses in key areas, under the Digital Europe Programme. This is probably part of the [Action 8 of DEAP](https://education.ec.europa.eu/focus-topics/digital-education/action-plan/action-8?) which aims to educate and train professionals in all sectors to use AI in their work. It interestingly mentions the [Digital Competence Framework v2.2](https://publications.jrc.ec.europa.eu/repository/handle/JRC128415), which seems to be yet another piece of the puzzle. 
- support networks of AI excellence centres to retain talent and develop PhD programmes and AI modules under the Horizon Europe programme. this is probably connected with the NoEs mentioned above
- und doctoral networks, postdoctoral fellowships and staff exchange projects in AI under the Marie Skłodowska-Curie actions. 
- support the development of new skills under the [Skills Agenda](https://ec.europa.eu/social/main.jsp?catId=1223&langId=en). 


### Developing a policy framework to ensure trust in AI systems
Basically ensuring that AI doesn't screw up society. 
Again we have more points here, with zero links but we can take guesses:
- a proposal for a horizontal framework for AI, focusing on safety and respect for fundamental rights specific to AI technologies. This smells alot like the [EU AI ACT](https://artificialintelligenceact.eu/)
- EU measures adapting the liability framework to the challenges of new technologies, including AI.
- revisions to existing sectoral safety legislation
- security operation centres, powered by AI, to act as a 'cybershield’ for the EU, able to detect signs of a cyberattack early enough and to enable proactive action

### Promoting the EU vision on sustainable and trustworthy AI in the world
This point is more about making Eu leader in regulations on ai. It follows the direction of the [Digital Compass](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/europes-digital-decade) and the [International outreach for human-centric artificial intelligence initiative](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/international-outreach-ai)
