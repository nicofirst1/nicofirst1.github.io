In the [previous post](https://nicofirst1.github.io/news/horizon-fragmentation/) we figured out that the Horizon Europe project contains some redundancies in (AI-related) project. My next step was to try and figure out how to suggest a fix to this problem, but in order to do so I had to dig deep in how EU handles AI projects and agendas. 
I started easy, asking chatgpt to provide a list of EU  policies/organizations and whatever related to AI. Of course the first one was the [EU AI Act](https://www.europarl.europa.eu/topics/en/article/20230601STO93804/eu-ai-act-first-regulation-on-artificial-intelligence) which I'm now familiar with and this just made me cocky in thinking I was already an expert in this. 
Well, the second suggestion was the [Coordinated Plan on Artificial Intelligence (PlanAI)](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/plan-ai). It's just a plan, how complicated can it be? 
Well, let's just say the rabit hole was deeper than expected. 

So, join me in this journey of dead-links and never-ending references. With this post (probably the first of a series), we'll sviscerate the PlanAI and see how many projects are connected to it. 
If you prefer a visual approach, I made this [nice graph](https://nicofirst1.github.io/euai_graph) where all these initiatives are connected and can be interacted with. The graph will be continuously updated so don't worry if some info is missing right now. 

Well, let's begin.


# Coordinated Plan on Artificial Intelligence
The PlanAI was first published in 2018 and then [reviewed in 2021](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/library/coordinated-plan-artificial-intelligence-2021-review) when the EU (and the world) realized the potential that AI can have. 
The changes between the two versions are mainly in the direction of:
- Planning: the 2021 version put an emphasis on human-centric, sustainable and secure AI. It also aims to achieve EU digital sovereignty.
- Funding: the main difference. The original plan was to invest at least €20 billion by 2020 using the Horizon 2020 and Horizon EU. The new plan upped the number quite a bit and amies now for €145 billion by 2023 using the Horizon EU, the [Digital Europe Programme](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/activities/digital-programme) and the [Recovery and Resilience Facility](https://next-generation-eu.europa.eu/recovery-and-resilience-facility_en).
- Funding: the main difference. The original plan was to invest at least €20 billion by 2020 using the Horizon 2020 and Horizon EU. The new plan upped the number quite a bit and amies now for €145 billion by 2023 using the Horizon EU, the [Digital Europe Programme](ht
- tps://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/activities/digital-programme) and the [Recovery and Resilience Facility](https://next-generation-eu.europa.eu/recovery-and-resilience-facility_en).

For everything else, the new PlanAI is based on 4 policies reflecting key objectives in AI. 


## 1. Enabling conditions for AI’s development and uptake
Let's abbreviate it to [EnablingAI](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/enabling-ai).
Here the aim is to actually have the resources necessary to have AI in EU. This translates in starting two new initiatives: AI Factories and GenAI4EU.

### 1.1 AI Factories
[Announced in Jan 2024](https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_24_383), The AI Factories will come to life in 2025 and are (for now), just an [amend](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/news/setting-ai-factories-now-possible-after-eurohpc-regulation-amendment) to the [The European High Performance Computing Joint Undertaking (EuroHPC JU)](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/high-performance-computing-joint-undertaking). 
So, for now, we only have a vague description of what a factory will look like. Specifically it will include a mix of hardware (supercomputer and data centers), "human capital" (I guess they mean experts from academia and research institutes) and startups/SMEs. 

But how?
Well, the commission and member states will invest an additional €2.1 billion to acquire more compute. On top of that the commission will provide financial support for startups (min €100 million) with a cap of €1 billion coming from [InvestEU](https://investeu.europa.eu/index_en).

### 1.2 GenAI4EU
Honestly I couldn't find much on what these are supposed to be. The description is "aims to support the development of novel use cases and emerging applications in Europe's 14 industrial ecosystems, as well as the public sector. Application areas include robotics, health, biotech, manufacturing, mobility, climate and virtual worlds." 
What I could find is that the commission is planning to use the Horizon Europe and the Digital Europe programmes to fund projects that are connected to industry application of GenAI (in the above field) for a total of €500 million [^1].
Also these initiatives will cooperate with the AI Factories and the [Common European Data Spaces](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/data-spaces). I guess the latter will provide compute/experts and the former data.
Finally, the [EU AI Office](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/ai-office) toghether with the [European Transition Pathways Platform will](https://single-market-economy.ec.europa.eu/industry/transition-pathways_en) monitor GenAI4EU's progress. 


[^1] : [Euractive article](https://www.euractiv.com/section/artificial-intelligence/news/leak-eu-commission-prepares-strategic-framework-to-boost-ai-start-ups-generative-ai-uptake/). I can't access the [science business one](https://sciencebusiness.net/news/r-d-funding/commission-shaping-eu500m-generative-artificial-intelligence-calls) :(

## 2. Thriving from the lab to the market

Also knows as [aiLabMarket](https://diorganisationsgital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/ai-lab-market), it basically they want to foster cooperation in AI in europe to attract talents and foster PPP. 
With this in mind:
-  they created [ADRA](https://adr-association.eu/) in june 2021, which is mostly related to PPP.
- It also created the [European Networks of Excellence in AI (NoEs) ](https://www.vision4ai.eu/community/) 
- from jan 2024, they also created the  [testing and experimentation facilities (TEFs)](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/activities/testing-and-experimentation-facilities)
- Then they decided to create the [AI-on-demand platform (AIoD)](https://www.ai4europe.eu/) which is the communication channel between researchers, industry and public services
- European Digital Innovation Hubs
- Fund and scale innovative ideas and solutions for AI where the eu plans to invest 1 billion per year in AI 



#####  AI, Data and Robotics Association (ADRA)
Adra was awarded 2.6B euros from the Horizon 2020 (2014-2020) and Horizon Europe (2021-2027). It's objective is to promote PPP and was created by the join effort of :
1. [Big Data Value Association (BDVA)](https://bdva.eu/)
2. [Confederation of Laboratories for Artificial Intelligence Research in Europe (CLAIRE)](https://claire-ai.org/)
3. [European Laboratory for Learning and Intelligent Systems (ELLIS)](https://ellis.eu/)
4. [European Association for Artificial Intelligence (EurAI)](https://www.eurai.org/)
5. [European Robotic Forum (euRobotics)](https://eu-robotics.net/)

They now have two taskforce, one for GenAI and won for GenAI applications in robotics. 
their Focus is Mainly on fostering PPPs, thus linking academic research with industrial application to create synergies and accelerate AI and robotics innovation.



#####  Networks of Excellence Centres (NoEs)

Funded under Horizon2020 and newly Horizon Europe. And includes 9 projects: 
1. [AI4media](https://www.ai4media.eu/)
2. [ELISE](https://www.elise-ai.eu/)
3. [Humane-AI net](https://www.humane-ai.eu/)
4. [TAILOR](https://tailor-network.eu/)
5. [ELSA](https://elsa-ai.eu/)
6. [euROBIN](https://www.eurobin-project.eu/)
7. [ELIAS](https://elias-ai.eu/)
8. [dAIedge](https://daiedge.eu/)
9. [Enfield](https://www.enfield-project.eu/)


Where the first 4 in 2020. 5 and 6 in 2022 and the last 3 since 2023
It reports to be strongly linked to ADRA and wants all the projects to communicate via the  [AI-on-demand platform (AIoD)](https://www.ai4europe.eu/) platform.

The whole site is actually hosted under the vision4ai name. 
The focus is Mainly academic, fostering research excellence and creating a critical mass of European AI knowledge and talent. They aim to push fundamental research and innovation in AI but have a more academic and research-oriented perspective compared to ADRA.



##### Testing and experimentation facilities (TEFs)

Of course you need to give spaces to SME (small and medium buisinesses), aka the startups in the PPP the eu wants to promote, space to test their ais. 
For this reason they created the [Testing and Experimentation Facilities (TEFs) for AI.](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/activities/testing-and-experimentation-facilities) (220 million) for t4 sectors : 
- Healthcare with [TEF-Health](https://tefhealth.eu/home)
- Agri-food with [AgrifoodTEF](https://www.agrifoodtef.eu/)
- Manufacturing with [AI Matters](https://ai-matters.eu/)
- Smart Cities & Communities with [Citcom.ai](https://citcom.ai/?trk=article-ssr-frontend-pulse_little-text-block)

Apparently they where tested in march 2024 and deemed to be ready to test SMEs.


##### AI-on-demand platform (AIoD)
Apart from having the slowest website ever which seems to be created by a particularly skilled 15 old teen, the platform is supported by an ecosystem of projects funded under Horizon 2020 and Horizon Europe (focus on research), and Digital Europe programme (focus on industry and public administration). The current version of the platform includes several services:
- An assets catalogue, aka the [MyLibrary](https://mylibrary.aiod.eu/marketplace) where you can get access to AI models, datasets and experiments on the dataset parts it seems to have only stuff from HF. The models seems to come from [Bonseyes](https://www.bonseyes.eu/) (a marketplace for AI in cloud and edge) and [OpenML](https://www.openml.org/) (another platform for AI stuff)
- [Research Bundles](https://www.ai4europe.eu/research/research-bundles) : give you a space in the AI on-demand platform where you can collect and publish the outputs of a small research project in a compact way. A research bundle collects in a single place all the assets (code, data, tutorials, examples, ...) produced by your project and published on the AI on-demand platform. Of course, you can also put links to assets published elsewhere, like Github or Zenodo.
- An [AI builder](https://aiexp.ai4europe.eu/#/home)  in partnership with Eclispe built at fraunohfer iais
- [Research and Innovation AI Lab (RAIL)](https://rail.aiod.eu/docs/about) a beta version of what seems to be an educational orietned platform to use AioD assets





#####  European Digital Innovation Hubs (EDIHs)
Seems to be another network dedicated to helping SME and PSO to digitalise and adhere to EU guidelines. Not really sure what's the difference between this and ADRA/NoES. The websites says "EDIHs help all companies seeking to use AI technologies to become more competitive on business/production processes, products or services."
This newtork also seems interested in [bringing AI in the public administration](https://european-digital-innovation-hubs.ec.europa.eu/knowledge-hub/thematic-groups/public-administration-main-focus-artificial-intelligence)

Unlike ADRA and NoEs, which focus more on research and innovation, EDIHs are focused on practical applications of AI technologies for businesses and public administration. They are key to promoting the digitalization of European industries.




#### 3. Ensuring that AI works for people (AI-People)

The last ai policy is [Ensuring that AI works for people](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/ai-people). It is split in 3 parts


##### Nurturing talent and improving skills
Basically they want to create and KEEP talents in AI in Europe.  They want to do so by: 
- Supporting traineeships in digital areas. They cite the [Digital Education Action Plan (DEAP)](https://education.ec.europa.eu/focus-topics/digital-education/action-plan) but it is unclear to which of the 13 articles this refers to. Or if the DEAP is part ot the coordinated plan (unlikely)
- Launch a call for specialised education programmes and courses in key areas, under the Digital Europe Programme. This is probably part of the [Action 8 of DEAP](https://education.ec.europa.eu/focus-topics/digital-education/action-plan/action-8?) which aims to educate and train professionals in all sectors to use AI in their work. It interestingly mentions the [Digital Competence Framework v2.2](https://publications.jrc.ec.europa.eu/repository/handle/JRC128415), which seems to be yet another piece of the puzzle. 
- support networks of AI excellence centres to retain talent and develop PhD programmes and AI modules under the Horizon Europe programme. this is probably connected with the NoEs mentioned above
- und doctoral networks, postdoctoral fellowships and staff exchange projects in AI under the Marie Skłodowska-Curie actions. 
- support the development of new skills under the [Skills Agenda](https://ec.europa.eu/social/main.jsp?catId=1223&langId=en). 


##### Developing a policy framework to ensure trust in AI systems
Basically ensuring that AI doesn't screw up society. 
Again we have more points here, with zero links but we can take guesses:
- a proposal for a horizontal framework for AI, focusing on safety and respect for fundamental rights specific to AI technologies. This smells alot like the [EU AI ACT](https://artificialintelligenceact.eu/)
- EU measures adapting the liability framework to the challenges of new technologies, including AI.
- revisions to existing sectoral safety legislation
- security operation centres, powered by AI, to act as a 'cybershield’ for the EU, able to detect signs of a cyberattack early enough and to enable proactive action

##### Promoting the EU vision on sustainable and trustworthy AI in the world
This point is more about making Eu leader in regulations on ai. It follows the direction of the [Digital Compass](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/europes-digital-decade) and the [International outreach for human-centric artificial intelligence initiative](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/international-outreach-ai)
