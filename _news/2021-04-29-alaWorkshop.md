After spending the past month implementing the reviews from the ALA workshop, I finally got accepted!

You can find my work on the [ALA2021 website]( https://ala2021.vub.ac.be/) under the *Spotlight* section.

######  Presentation and Video
They asked me to come up with some [slides](https://ala2021.vub.ac.be/presentations/pres_paper4.pdf) and record a [presentation](https://youtu.be/3Ddt7FNnjGk). 
Even tho I wasn't really into the presentation, I wrote the speech and learned to use OBSstudio (which I'm using with my students too) in order to record a nice video.

###### Live Q&A
For my final delight, I agreed to take part in a live Q&A presentation which will be on two different days :

- *2021/05/03* at 18:30 at [this meet]( https://meet.google.com/rkf-pxwg-cvg) .
- *2021/05/04* at 14:00 at [this meet](https://meet.google.com/dgu-ddeq-bof) .
