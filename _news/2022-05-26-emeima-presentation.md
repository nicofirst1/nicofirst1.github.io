## Lightning Talks
The Lightning Talks series is organized by CLAIRE Rising Researchers Network; connecting young researchers in AI across Europe. In this series, our members present their research topics to showcase the wide variety of themes AI research entails.

## Abstract
 Recent advances in the field of Emergent communication [EmCom] show a fundamental difference between human and machine language emergence. On the other hand, EmCom has been proven to be an effective framework to train Question Answering models. In this project, we extend the concept of EmCom to images and present the Emergent ImageNation [EmIn] framework.
