## About the training school

The training school on ``Representation Mediated Multimodality'' provides a consolidated perspective on the theoretical, methodological, and applied understanding of representation mediated multimodal sensemaking at the interface of language, knowledge representation and reasoning, and visuo-auditory computing. Intended purposes -addressed in the school- encompass diverse operative needs such as explainable multimodal commonsense understanding, multimodal generation/synthesis for communication, multimodal summarisation, multimodal interpretation guided decision-support, adaptation & autonomy, and analytical visualization.

The training school hosts an invited faculty delivering lectures, intensive tutorials, and keynotes; opportunities also exist for young researchers to position ongoing / early stage research, discuss, and network with school faculty and participants.
