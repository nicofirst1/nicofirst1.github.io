#### Leading the JUPITER AI Factory from Fraunhofer IAIS

As Fraunhofer IAIS lead for the JUPITER AI Factory, I coordinate the institute’s contribution to building Europe’s first large-scale AI compute and data infrastructure.  
Our work focuses on developing federated pipelines for multilingual data, ensuring reproducibility, and aligning industrial and research partners across the European AI ecosystem.

The goal of JUPITER is to create an open, sovereign foundation for AI innovation in Europe—linking compute capacity, datasets, and evaluation practices under a unified framework.  
From the Fraunhofer side, we drive the design of scalable data governance, ethical standards, and evaluation loops that make this infrastructure both technically sound and socially responsible.
