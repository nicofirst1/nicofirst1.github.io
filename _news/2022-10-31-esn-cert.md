During my time studying in Rome, Italy from March 2021 to October 2022, I became a partner of the Erasmus Student Network (ESN). As a member of the network, I contributed to the planning and coordination of various events while also serving as a liaison for incoming Erasmus students. Through my involvement with ESN, I gained valuable experience in event management and cross-cultural communication, and had the opportunity to meet students from all around the world.
