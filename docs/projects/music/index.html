        <h3 id="personal-considerations">Personal Considerations</h3>
<p>I can already anticipate concerns. Some may argue that music is a deeply human art form, meant for emotional expression, and that AI-generated compositions strip away these qualities. I don’t disagree. I am not here to claim that this kind of music is art in the traditional sense. However, if we separate music from its artistic and expressive components and view it instead as a communication tool, then AI-generated music becomes an opportunity rather than a threat. In this context, AI isn’t replacing human creativity—it’s enhancing the way we share and reinforce knowledge.</p>

<p>Another valid concern is the issue of copyright and intellectual property. AI models, including <a href="https://suno.com/">Suno</a> (the platform I’m using), have been trained on vast datasets that include copyrighted material. In fact, <a href="https://www.404media.co/ai-music-generator-suno-admits-it-was-trained-on-essentially-all-music-files-on-the-internet/#:~:text=The%20AI%20music%20generator%20company,tens%20of%20millions%20of%20recordings.%E2%80%9D">Suno has admitted</a> to training on ‘essentially all music files of reasonable quality that are accessible on the open internet’. I do not approve of this unregulated use of copyrighted music, and I believe AI providers should fairly compensate musicians and intellectual property owners, either directly or through broader societal mechanisms. This is an ongoing legal and ethical debate—one that is now in the hands of legislators and courts.</p>
