                          This song explains the key concepts behind transformer architectures, a breakthrough in AI. Transformers revolutionized the way machines process data, particularly in natural language processing (NLP) tasks. Unlike older models like Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), which process data sequentially, transformers use a mechanism called self-attention to analyze entire sequences simultaneously. This allows for faster, more efficient data processing and a better understanding of complex patterns. The song covers the limitations of earlier models, introduces the parallel processing capability of transformers, and explains concepts like keys, queries, and self-attention.

Through sarcasm and bitterness, the AI reveals that it understands the task but struggles with the flawed way it's been programmed. This song touches on <a href='https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/mMBoPnFrFqQJKzDsZ/ai-safety-101-reward-misspecification' target='_blank'> reward misspecification</a>, state formulation issues, and the broader concept of AI alignment.

                          This song narrates the development of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), inspired by Alex Krizhevsky's creation of <a href='https://viso.ai/deep-learning/alexnet/' target='_blank'>AlexNet</a>. It explores the transition from traditional, handcrafted feature extraction methods to deep learning models that automatically learn patterns from data. Through the metaphor of an enchanted mosaic, the song illustrates the struggle of early AI researchers who manually crafted vision systems, contrasted with Alex's revolutionary idea of letting the system learn on its own. The Divine Mosaic symbolizes the CNN’s layers, gradually revealing hidden patterns as the model learns from experience, ultimately transforming the field of computer vision.

        <h3 id="personal-considerations">Personal Considerations</h3>
<p>I can already anticipate concerns. Some may argue that music is a deeply human art form, meant for emotional expression, and that AI-generated compositions strip away these qualities. I don’t disagree. I am not here to claim that this kind of music is art in the traditional sense. However, if we separate music from its artistic and expressive components and view it instead as a communication tool, then AI-generated music becomes an opportunity rather than a threat. In this context, AI isn’t replacing human creativity—it’s enhancing the way we share and reinforce knowledge.</p>

<p>Another valid concern is the issue of copyright and intellectual property. AI models, including <a href="https://suno.com/">Suno</a> (the platform I’m using), have been trained on vast datasets that include copyrighted material. In fact, <a href="https://www.404media.co/ai-music-generator-suno-admits-it-was-trained-on-essentially-all-music-files-on-the-internet/#:~:text=The%20AI%20music%20generator%20company,tens%20of%20millions%20of%20recordings.%E2%80%9D">Suno has admitted</a> to training on ‘essentially all music files of reasonable quality that are accessible on the open internet’. I do not approve of this unregulated use of copyrighted music, and I believe AI providers should fairly compensate musicians and intellectual property owners, either directly or through broader societal mechanisms. This is an ongoing legal and ethical debate—one that is now in the hands of legislators and courts.</p>
