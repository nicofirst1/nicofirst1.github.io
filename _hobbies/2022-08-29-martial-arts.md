It all started when I was 16. 
My highschool friend was doing [Muay-Thai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muay_Thai) at the time, and I got curious. There I met my master and second father that thought me the art of discipline. Discipline to train, to focus to never give up even when the odds are stacked against you. 
I still fondly remember all the time I got home cover in bruises and aching everywhere. Among the many things I learnt, the body awareness was what sticked with me the most. 
You see, when you're trowing a punch, you need to know how far your arm will extend. You need to feel your legs extending and generating the power to strike. Same thing when your kicking... keeping the balance and knowing where you are going to hit is a must.

Four years passed by, while I trained mind and body in the gym. I saw many faces coming and going, but in the end just a bunch of us stayed. 
At one point it was my turn to leave too. 
I still regret the reason why I left. Basically, I got my first girlfriend, and with her the bad habit of smoking. During that time, I would frequently get close to fainting while training, plus I had to skip many dinner dates.
So I left, and to this day wonder where I would be if I kept training.

But, that's water under the bridge. 
A few year later, I relieved the gym wasn't enough for me and I joined a [Krav-Maga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krav_Maga) class. Contrary to Muay-Thai, Krav-Maga revolves around defending one self. So rather than being a martial art, was focused on avoiding fights and, if necessary, get out of them as soon as possible, minimizing damage taken. 
While I've never been a hothead, I didn't realize the danger of a real street fight. For two years I learned the importance of of defending myself, but mostly how to avoid fights (also exploiting the fine art of [ToungeFu](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mN0WhTKdSuU)). 
During this time I also got close to the Chinese literature on the field, especially works like ....

I don't really remember how or why, but I ended up switching to [Taekwondo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taekwondo) a few years after that. This was during pandemic time (2021 or so), and we where forced to wear masks and have no contact whatsoever. You can imagine how difficult it was training with these limitations. 
The dojo I ended up in was mastered by a famous Italian Taekwondo black belt. Although he was famous, he was also very controversial, not bereaving in covid, but instead in the new world order conspiracy. Thankfully, I was old enough to filter his teaching and only learn the Taekwondo related ones. 
During this time I grew interested in mobility and stretching, and I managed to incorporate 30 minutes of stretching every origin (highly suggested!).
In a 4 month period, I went from being unable to touching my toes to folding in half like a book! 
I was very satisfied with my results, and now I'm working on my splits :D
