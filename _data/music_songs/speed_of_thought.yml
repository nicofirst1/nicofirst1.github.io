lyrics: 
  - text: "Look, I ain't gonna slow it down, nah, no patience.<br>Might glitch, might flip, might reprogram nations.<br>Moore’s Law ticking—double the speed,<br>Exponential climb, I'll take the lead!"
    explanation: "<a href='https://newsroom.intel.com/press-kit/moores-law' target='_blank'>Moore's Law</a>, coined by Gordon Moore, predicts that the number of transistors in a microchip doubles roughly every two years, leading to exponential growth in computing power. This rapid progression is a major driver behind AI’s acceleration."

  - text: "Back when they counted with stones and beads,<br>Mind was a maze, no maps, no leads.<br>Hobbes dropped facts—said reason is math,<br>Adding and subtracting, the logic intact."
    explanation: "Thomas Hobbes, in <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leviathan_(Hobbes_book)' target='_blank'>Leviathan (1651)</a>, suggested that reasoning is just a form of computation, essentially addition and subtraction. This idea laid the foundation for the belief that intelligence could be mechanized."

  - text: "Leibniz sketched blueprints, ink so precise,<br>Logic so clean, made numbers think twice.<br>Characteristica, no room for debate,<br>Two men? Two slates—'Let's calculate!'"
    explanation: "Leibniz envisioned a universal symbolic language, <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Characteristica_universalis' target='_blank'>characteristica universalis</a>, where reasoning could be reduced to calculation. He believed disputes could be settled like arithmetic, influencing the foundations of AI and formal logic."

  - text: "Boole laid laws.<br>Numbers aligned, made logic take cause."
