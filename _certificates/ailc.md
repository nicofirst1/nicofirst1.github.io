I participated in the 2023 edition of the Lectures on Computational Linguistics, a conference dedicated to central themes in the field of computational linguistics.  The interdisciplinary nature of the conference encompassed topics in theoretical and applied linguistics, digital humanities, computer science, engineering, artificial intelligence, and cognitive sciences. The Lectures included tutorials, workshops, and seminars focusing on the latest models of learning and knowledge representation in mono- and multi-modal contexts, with a particular emphasis on neural language models.
