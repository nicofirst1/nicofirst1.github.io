During the summer of 2022, I completed a 5 month scientific visiting period at the University of Amsterdam, under the supervision of Professor Raquel Fern√°ndez. During my research visit, I had the opportunity to work in the field of natural language processing, where I collaborated to develop innovative algorithms for generative modeling. The experience was incredibly rewarding, and I gained valuable insights into the research process, as well as the opportunity to connect with other researchers and experts in my field. I look forward to continuing my work in this area and building on the skills and knowledge gained during my time at UvA.
