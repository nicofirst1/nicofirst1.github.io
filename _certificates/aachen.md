I was honored to receive a scholarship to attend the ["Future of AI" Summit](https://www.aim.rwth-aachen.de/ai-summit/) in Aachen. This exclusive event, hosted at RWTH Aachen University from September 27 to 28, 2023, brought together young researchers in AI from across Germany. Organized by Professor Holger Hoos and Professor Aimee van Wynsberghe under the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation, the summit provided a unique platform for networking, research presentation, and engagement with renowned AI professors.
