During my Ph.D. studies in Artificial Intelligence, I joined the Confederation of Laboratories for Artificial Intelligence Research in Europe (CLAIRE) and became a member of the Researcher to Network (R2Net) initiative. Through R2Net, I had the opportunity to participate in partnerships, social events, and summer schools organized by CLAIRE. These experiences helped me to expand my network, learn from other researchers in the field, and develop my skills in Artificial Intelligence.
