As a PhD student representative at Sapienza University, I have served as a liaison between the student body and the administration. In this role, I have advocated for the needs and concerns of my fellow students and worked towards creating a positive and productive learning environment for all.

My responsibilities have included communicating with the administration on behalf of the student body, organizing meetings and events to promote dialogue and collaboration, and providing guidance and support to students in need. I have also worked closely with other student representatives to ensure that the voices of all PhD students are heard and that our concerns are addressed in a timely and effective manner.

Through my work as a PhD student representative, I have developed strong communication, organizational, and leadership skills. I am proud to have had the opportunity to serve my fellow students and to contribute to the overall success of the PhD program at Sapienza University.
