As an active member of the Rotaract Club RTMM, a community-based organization, I work as an informatics consultant, helping to design and implement technology solutions to support our club’s various initiatives. Rotaract is a global organization that provides an opportunity for young professionals to network, develop leadership skills, and engage in service projects that promote positive change in their communities. As a Rotaract partner (socio), I am committed to supporting the club’s mission and contributing to its efforts to create a better world through volunteerism and social responsibility.
