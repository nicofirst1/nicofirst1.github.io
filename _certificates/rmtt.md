I have been an active member of the Rotaract Club Roma Capitale in Rome, Italy since April 2018. As an informatics consultant, I help design and implement technology solutions to support the club's various initiatives. The Rotaract Club is a global organization that provides young professionals with an opportunity to network, develop leadership skills, and engage in service projects that promote positive change in their communities. As a Rotaract partner (socio), I am committed to supporting the club's mission and contributing to its efforts to create a better world through volunteerism and social responsibility.
