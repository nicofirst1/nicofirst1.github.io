During my Ph.D. studies, I joined the R2Net, a network for Ph.D. students interested in Artificial Intelligence created by the Confederation of Laboratories for Artificial Intelligence Research in Europe (CLAIRE). As a member of the R2Net, I was involved in organizing partnerships, social events, and summer schools. After 10 months, I was promoted to kernel member, becoming the first line of contact between CLAIRE and our R2Net members. Through my involvement in CLAIRE R2Net, I gained valuable experience in networking and organizing events, and had the opportunity to meet and work with talented Ph.D. students from all over Europe.
